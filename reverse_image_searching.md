The most useful and relevant reverse image searching sites are [Google Images](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl), [trace.moe](https://trace.moe/), [SauceNao](http://saucenao.com/), [IQDB](http://www.iqdb.org/) and [Tinyeye](https://www.tineye.com/). They all do different things, so depending on what you are looking for a certain site may be better to use than others. There are also useful plugins for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-search-options/kljmejbpilkadikecejccebmccagifhl?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/EN-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/) that let you access the reverse searches with a simple right click. Also, for Chrome users, pressing "s" after right clicking on an image will reverse search it through google for you. **TL;DR at the end if you would rather not read all the details.**

I will be using  [this as ex.1](http://cdn.awwni.me/nyg0.jpg) and [this as ex.2](http://i.imgur.com/33Q0kyn.jpg) to show the strengths and weaknesses of certain reverse searches. 

[Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl): [Here is a little gif to show the different options](http://www.gfycat.com/HospitableDigitalIndianrhinoceros). You can choose to either upload the image url, or the file if you have it saved. Generally it is easier to copy and paste an image url. Google will generally give you the name of the character or show for most images, depending on the image. If it is an often used reaction image or meme occasionally you will only get more results pointing to meme sites or tumblr pages. 

[Here](http://goo.gl/2il2HY) is what the results for ex.1 should be. As you can see, it gives the show name "No Game No Life", and the character "Jibril". [Here](http://goo.gl/74CDC2) is the result for ex.2. Most of the results link to pages related to the author, Ume Aoki, but the later results have the show "Kill la Kill" and the character "RyÅ«ko Matoi". Google will almost always find the show if it is official art or a good screencap of a character. 

[Trace.moe](https://trace.moe/): Great if you have a screenshot from an anime, not good if it's been edited or cropped in any significant way. It uses a color layout descriptor to match images to clips of anime and tells you what anime it is, including a short preview video for verification.

[SauceNAO](http://saucenao.com/): Probably the best site by far if you are looking for the artist for fan art. It searches Pixiv and Nico Nico Seiga, among [other sites](http://saucenao.com/status.html). Generally will get you a direct link to the work and artist, and for official art it will list the artist, series, and characters. It will also pull the pixiv page even if the work has been deleted, so you can still find the artist's other works if you are interested. SauceNao will also tell you how similar your image and it's results are in the upper right corner as a %. It does have difficulty searching altered, filtered or cropped images. If you have an image that may be cropped, try searching it through google to see if you can find the full image and then search that through SauceNao. If you have a wallpaper, cropping out the extra background space usually helps too. Art on Pixiv is always tagged, so you can stick some of them in google translate and it should give you the show it is from or if it is an original work. 

[Here](http://saucenao.com/search.php?db=999&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.awwni.me%2Fnyg0.jpg) is the result for ex.1 It links directly to the pixiv illistration and author page. It has 97.44% similarity.

[Here](http://saucenao.com/search.php?db=999&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F33Q0kyn.jpg) is the result for ex.2 Notice that because the image was not uploaded onto any of it's searched sites it does not have an accurate source. It gives the top result, which happens to have 52.22%, usually anything below 80% won't be accurate. 

**[If you notice under "Your Image", it also has links to the Google, IQDB, and Tinyeye searches.](http://i.imgur.com/CZcDahB.png) This can save you the time from having to do each search individually, as you can do a SauceNao search and it will give you links to the other searches.**

*Please Note:* SauceNao will also link to *NSFW* results sometimes, as it does also search for hentai and ecchi images. Generally clicking *Low similarity results have been hidden. Click here to display them...* is a waste of time. 

[IQDB](http://www.iqdb.org/): Searchs the largest anime realted image boards and boorus. It won't link you to the original source or show, but rather other sites where the image has been rehosted. While this may not seem useful at first, many of the sites it links to have extensive tagging systems that should tell you the show, characters, and artist, among other interesting information. It will also list similarity % like SauceNao, and may also have NSFW results. The "other results" section is generally unhelpful as well, and may contain NSFW results.

[Ex.1](http://iqdb.org/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.awwni.me%2Fnyg0.jpg)  lists what the safety the sites have them tagged as (Safe, Ero). [Ex.2](http://iqdb.org/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F33Q0kyn.jpg)  Notice for both of these it does not list the show, character, or artist itself, but instead links to sites that do. 

Last but not least is [Tinyeye](https://www.tineye.com/): This site is similar to Google in that it is not anime specific, it will pull results from all over the web. It is much better at recognizing Deviantart results than SauceNao. If it notices an image was taken from Deviantart it will often highlight it and have it as it's first result. It has different ways to filter results, generally Oldest is the best to find the source, and best match can be good if your image is close to the source. Please note that for wallpapers it will often link to dozens of different wallpaper sites. 

[Ex.1 ](http://tineye.com/search/32f7d2374df1797b321485b54bb674867d3fea9d/) mostly links to pixiv and reddit. [Ex.2](http://tineye.com/search/c5e1efb941fb16945e73447e5e47462e7e02f136/) mostly links to reddit and a few other image boards. Neither have too many results. 





**TL;DR** Use SauceNAO if you want to find an artist or source, and if it doesn't work use the [links to the other searches it provides under "Your "Image.](http://i.imgur.com/CZcDahB.png) If you just want to know the name of a show or character a Google search should usually work. Get the "Image Search Options" plugin.
