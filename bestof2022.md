/u/Abysswatcherbel | ["For their weekly infographic posts of r/anime karma rankings (like this one). It must take a lot of dedication to gather all that data every week and put it together into a sleek and readable format. I love reviewing them every Sunday and seeing how each show stacks up. It gives me an idea of what's going on in the anime world, even if I'm just watching a single show at a time. And I've often looked back to reference weeks from past seasons that I may have missed."](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/108phqx/best_of_ranime_2022_day_5_most_valuable/j3to0m1/) | /u/Ponkool4

/u/Nazenn | ["They always have insightful commentary and analysis, and are happy to help with rewatch logistics and suggestions for schedule/timing tweaks.
