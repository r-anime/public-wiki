### Overview

Depending on where, how, and in what language you are watching, many of these series are localized under other names and/or further divided into smaller "series" or "seasons".
 
The characters and media names below are listed with the official Japanese names, followed by their most common English localizations in parentheses:

### Other Anime in the Main Series
 
* The 2019 theatrical film ***Mewtwo Strikes Back - Evolution*** is a CGI remake of the original *Mewtwo Strikes Back* film. There are no substantial story differences between the two.
* There are 3 ***Pikachu's Winter Vacation*** OVAs released in 1998, 1999, and 2000, consisting of 2, 2, and 3 episodes, respectively. The first OVA can be said to loosely fit into the main anime continuity, while the second and third OVAs have dubious continuity with the rest of the main series (hence, are not listed below). In general, these can all be watched at any time after episode 50 of the original series.
    * Episode 22 of *Pokémon Chronicles* is an edited version of the first *Pikachu's Winter Vacation* OVA (1998)
    * The second *Pikachu's Winter Vacation* OVA (1999) is not included in *Pokémon Chronicles*.
    * Episode 4 of *Pokémon Chronicles* is the first and second episode of the third *Pikachu's Winter Vacation* OVA (2000).
    * Episode 20 of *Pokémon Chronicles* is the third episode of the third *Pikachu's Winter Vacation* OVA (2000). (The first and second episode of this OVA are not included in *Pokémon Chronicles*.)
* There are also 9 theatrical shorts which aired alongside the pokémon feature films in Japan, several shorts made exclusively for the airline ANA's in-flight entertainment, and a few miscellaneous other shorts. Collectively, these are often referred to as the "Pikachu Shorts" and have been re-aired/re-released under that name or similar. These are also of dubious continuity with the rest of the main series (hence, are not listed below). In any case, they have no particular impact on the rest of the main series, so you can skip them or watch them at your own discretion.
* An OVA called *Pichu Bros. in Party Panic* was released in 2003 through the GameCube Pokémon Channel. It is of dubious continuity/canon, but would most likely take place just after episode 133 of the *Advanced Generation* series.
