#**Precure**

Precure exists on the same formula as Super Sentai, Kamen Rider or Power Rangers; each series in the franchise lasts for a year and is completely self contained from any other series in the franchise. Precure has existed for over a decade and is primarily aimed towards children as young as 5 who have not seen much of the franchise. Precure needs to be accessible for the revolving door of children who are viewers, so every series in the franchise can be seen with no prior knowledge, even the two sequel series are very accessible. Toei has kept all references and connections between series completely isolated in the crossover movies. 

So the answer to the question “Where do I start?” has no wrong answer. Any point is a valid starting point. You can start from the beginning, pick the best, or a lot of people suggest just picking the series with the designs that most appeal to you.

 To help guide new viewers here is a quick guide to each series, in release order, as well as when to watch the movies for each series. Note that all movies are optional and can be skipped.

**Futari wa Precure**: The Original Precure. Isn’t entirely representative of modern Precure, with a more grounded approach to the world. The colors are more earthy instead of the bright Pinks, Blues and Yellows, and the Precure don’t fight in heels, with a world that far more represents our own. Dated animation from 2004 and lower budget from being an original anime, as well as the story being originally planned to be only 2 cours instead of the eventual 8 hold the series back by modern standards. Crunchyroll has the license for this series, but in VHS quality 90’s sub.
