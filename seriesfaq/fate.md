#TL;DR: [**Simplified order here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatestaynight/comments/df8rvo/rfatestaynights_official_viewing_order_guide_v2/) with a more in-depth guide below.

*This spoiler-free guide is written for people interested in the Fate series but have little to no knowledge about it and how to get into it.*

**VN = Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel. LN = Light Novel. F/Z = Fate/Zero. UBW = Unlimited Blade Works. HF = Heaven's Feel.**


###**General Info you should know:**

Fate/Stay Night is originally a visual novel with 3 routes: Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel. The story basically separates at a point early on into each of the three routes. Each route have the same setting and characters, but completely different stories and themes. They **must** be played in that order as they build off of the previous route.

[Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/manga/3649/Fate_Zero) was written afterwards as a light novel by Urobuchi Gen. It was a prequel that expanded on past events talked about in the F/SN VN, and was written with the intent that readers finished all 3 routes of the visual novel.

As for the anime adaptions, [Fate/Stay Night \(2006\)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night) by Studio DEEN was an adaptation of the first route of the VN (Fate), but also tried to incorporate parts from the other routes (therefore spoiling them) and did not portray the main character (Shirou) correctly, leading to an overall mediocre adaption. They also made a [movie adaption of UBW](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6922/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Unlimited_Blade_Works), which compressed a 20 hour story into 2-hours by taking out most of the context that leads to each event.  It's highly recommended that newcomers **do not** watch either adaptions by DEEN.

Ufotable's first adaption of the Fate series was [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero), which has two seasons (25 episodes total). They've made an adaption of the UBW route, which has a [Prologue Episode](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue) and [two seasons](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22297/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works) (26 episodes total). They're also currently working on a HF adaption which is set to be a trilogy of movies, with the [first movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_-_I_Presage_Flower) already out, the [second movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33049/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_-_II_Lost_Butterfly) being released on blu-ray on August 21st, and [third](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33050/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_III_Spring_Song) set to air in theatres sometime in 2020.

There are currently no plans to do a better adaptation of the Fate route, so the only way to experience that is reading the VN.

-----------------------------
###Where should I start?


If you want to become deeply invested with the Fate franchise and want to enjoy its story to its maximum potential, the best way to go about that is to **read the Visual Novel**. Everyone who started with the visual novel and finished all 3 routes have absolutely 0 regrets with the way they approached the series. It starts off slow but most people get hooked half way through the Fate route. Once you've read all 3 routes, you can watch or read Fate/Zero while being able to understand and catch everything. From here, you'll have a lot of freedom of what part of the Fate franchise you'll want to delve into next.

For a ***simplified guide***, follow [**this flowchart**](https://i.imgur.com/Tvpgtlj.png).

For an ***in-depth guide***, read the following:

**What if I don't want to sink in the time to finish the entire thing?**
 
Then you can try just the Fate portion of the VN (average completion being 20hrs). While most think it's a great read (albeit slow at first), it's considered the weakest route of the VN only because UBW and HF are that good. The Fate route sets the foundation of the story and builds up the world and characters. It's also the only way you'll get to experience Saber's full story and character development, as the route mainly revolves around her and Shirou. Once you've finished the Fate route you can then move onto the UBW anime, wait for the HF movies to be released and watch those, then watch Fate/Zero.

**What if I'm fine with reading VNs and the time sink, but I'm just not interested enough in the story to continue reading?**

Then watch the UBW prologue (episode 0) and see if that interests you enough since it's almost identical to the prologue of the VN before you make any choices in-game.

**What if I don't like the medium? Or I just want my first experience with this series to be in anime form?**

This is where things get very complicated and you'll find mixed opinions on this matter. Leaving out the DEEN adaptions, we have two choices: **Fate/Zero**, the adaption of the prequel LN written after F/SN was released. And **Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works**, the adaption of the 2nd route of the VN.

Let's start with UBW. While miles better than DEEN's UBW movie, it's still not a perfect adaption. In that it does not capture certain scenes and character thoughts as well as the VN does due to the VN being written in first-person. And since you start with UBW, skipping the worldbuilding and character development you get from the Fate route, it makes it even harder to understand some of the scenes, characters and the overall story. Unless you have crazy good analysis skills or want to challenge yourself, you'll either not enjoy it as much as you should or you'll be finding yourself constantly wanting to know more. If it's the latter, then it would be a good opportunity to read the Fate route and HF route, possibly the UBW route in-between if you want that extra characterization you didn't get in the anime. If you're still not wanting to read the VN but patient enough to wait for the HF movies, you can watch those as they release and then move on to Fate/Zero. 

**What if I know for sure that I'll never read the VN even after I finish UBW *and* I don't want to wait for the HF movies?**

Instead, it might be better to start with Fate/Zero. Being ufotable's first anime of the Fate series, it's considered very well adapted, highly praised, and was a lot of peoples first start into the series. As it's written by Gen Urobuchi, it's got a different tone and focus to it than Fate and UBW, and most people find it easier to get into Fate/Zero over UBW due to F/Z's single narrative and third-person structure being easier to adapt. But because it was originally a prequel meant to be read after all three routes of F/SN, it ends up spoiling many twists of the VN. The routes suffering most from the spoilers are Fate and HF, UBW is barely affected. And to enjoy Fate/Zero like the author originally intended and understand all the references, hints, and even the ending, you'll need knowledge from F/SN, particularly from HF. As a refresher for F/SN fans, Fate/Zero skims through the concepts of the setting and gives a little bit of worldbuilding from the Fate route (although not a substitute, think 'reading a book' vs 'reading a summary of the book'). Because of this, it may be better to watch Fate/Zero before watching UBW instead of vice-versa. **Note:** Do *not* think of UBW as a sequel to Fate/Zero. As I said, they're both written by different writers and have a different focus and tone to them.

Starting with either UBW or Fate/Zero both have their consequences, and it's best to know these consequences beforehand. If you can't enjoy one, try the other. 

**TLDR:** VN (Fate->UBW->HF)->Fate/Zero is the proper and intended order. If you can't get through the Fate route of the VN (~20hrs), try the UBW anime or Fate/Zero anime (Read the problems of starting either first above). 

**Side notes:** 

* UBW is not a complete story. If you feel like something is missing, it's most likely explained in another route. If a character didn't get enough screen time, they will in another route.

* Do **not** read HF without having first read or watched the entirety of Fate and UBW.

* F/SN does talk about F/Z's ending because F/Z was written to expand on that event. F/Z, being written as a prequel, is more about the journey than the outcome.

* If you've finished the VN but have watched Fate/Zero before it, I highly recommend giving Fate/Zero a rewatch to see what you missed.

* You can either read or watch Fate/Zero, the only difference being that the LN has extra scenes and characterization while the anime has visuals/music/voice acting/etc.

* You can read the sequel VN to Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, anytime after you read F/SN. Info on how to install it can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatestaynight/comments/7589y1/hollow_ataraxia_voice_insertion_patch/).

-----------------------------
###**Any other Fate works?**

There's a bunch of other spin-offs you can view [**here**](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Fate_series). Albeit not a terrible idea, it's generally not recommended to dive into the spin-offs if you don't have F/SN and F/Z under your belt. Even better if you've finished Fate/Hollow Ataraxia too.

-----------------------------
###**What is a visual novel?**

A novel game where you click to advance the text. They have sprites, effects, pictures, voice acting, and music. You occasionally run into decisions with multiple choices throughout the game and they lead to different events. Depending on the structure, the storyline branches into different "routes" during points in the story where events play significantly different from each other. The choices you've made before that point determine which route you enter.

More info [**here**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel).

-----------------------------
###**Where can I get the game?**

Due to the subreddit's rules, I can't exactly tell you where to get the game but try searching up "Fate/stay night [Realta Nua] for Windows". **Do not get the Fuwa version** because it's an outdated release without the extras in the latest patch mentioned above. If you're unsure if you have the right version, check your exe icons with [**this**](http://i.imgur.com/5iDOgzS.png).

Get the latest Realta Nua PC fan patch [**here**](http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/4745-Fate-Stay-Night-Realta-Nua-PC-version-Mirror-Moon-TL-insertion-project) if it's not already patched. **Do not** watch the video in the link because it contains HF spoilers.

To avoid running into an error when the vita openings play at the end of Day 3, get the latest LAV filter [**here**](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases/download/0.62/LAVFilters-0.62-Installer.exe). You may not need the LAV filter if you have CCCP. I recommend skipping the vita openings and watching them after their route because they contain spoilers about events to come. To skip it, click on it or press CTRL.

You can get a flowchart walkthrough pdf [**here**](http://jackk3000.intarbutt.info/datazz/FSN_Flowchart.pdf) (just right click->Save As). This walkthrough will have a few decisions from the old version that won't show up in Realta Nua. If you plan on using it, a good way to finding the choices you're on is hitting Ctrl + F and typing in one of the choices.

###**F/SN VN Notes:**

* Make sure you read the VN in this order: **Fate->Unlimited Blade Works->Heaven's Feel.**

* The game will start with a prologue from Rin's perspective after a brief scene, once it's over it'll take you to the main menu. You can then click on Start to continue after the prologue. If you want to view the prologue again, go to the Extras menu.

* If you prefer the original version of a specific soundtrack, you can change it in the [**options**](http://i.imgur.com/GlWZW4R.png).

* The Fate route has one ending while UBW and HF routes each have two (Good End and True End).

* There is a bonus scene called the "Last Episode" which you unlock after getting all 5 endings.

-----------------------------
###**General VN tips:**

* Right click to access the menu. 

* Make the first save slot your "bookmark" and save over it every time you're about to close the game. 

* Whenever choices pops up, remember to save in an empty save slot before choosing so you can go back and choose again any time. If you forgot to save, you can easily go back since the game will always ask you if you want to skip a segment of the story you've already read.

* You can hold the CTRL button to quickly skip through text. Be careful though, you might skip through text you haven't read yet.

* Scroll up to access the text log which shows previously read text.

###**VN FAQ:**
**Q: I keep getting this bluescreen error whenever I open the game, how do I fix it?**

A: You either haven't put the "faterealtanua_savedata" folder in your *documents* or you're using a locale that isn't English or Japanese. If it's the latter, either [change your locale](http://fuwanovel.net/faq/setting-windows-to-japanese-locale) or use [AppLocale](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=329).

**Q: I've already started playing one of the older versions, what should I do?**

A: There is no reason not to play the Realta Nua PC version as it has everything the older versions have and more. It's generally subjective whether it's worth switching over midway through a route, but if you've already finished a route and you're going to start another one, you definitely want to make the switch. When switching, absolutely make sure you hold the CTRL button through everything you've already read. Even if you've finished a route, hold CTRL through the entire thing before starting. It makes it easier to skip things you've already read during the first few days of the new route and also helps getting one of the requirements to unlocking the Last Episode out of the way early.

**Q: Can I use the RN patch on an old version?**

No.

**Q: Can I move my old save files to the Realta Nua PC version?**

No.

**Q: The Status screen doesn't show in the HF route but it does in the others, how do I get to it?**

You can get to the Status screen in the Extras menu on the title screen (Save and go to Return to top). The cause of this is skipping the "Saber explains the rules" scene on the 4th day. If you were to choose to not skip that scene then skip it by holding CTRL, it should show up again.

**Q: Can I go into another route by mistake?**

Because the routes are split up into their own games in Realta Nua, you're essentially locked in that route. All choices that lead you into other routes are removed.

###**Fate Spin-Offs:**


Without going into much detail, there are a few interesting Fate spin-offs you can watch. Some are complete shows in alternate timelines with completely different plots, while others are full of "memes" and in-jokes. All of them are best watched after UBW.

**Carnival Phantasm:**

in-jokes: the anime. Best watched after you've finished at least one of the VNs (Fate/Stay Night or Tsukihime) preferably both. 

**Fate/Grand Order:**

Fate/Grand Order is a mobile video game based on the fate franchise(available for free in NA). It has its own OVAs and specials, but there's no real anime for it. There's an upcoming anime project that is going to adapt the later stages of the game's storyline, so overall you're better off playing the game so you can experience the story in full.

If you want a taste of the plot, there's an OVA called [First Order.](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34321/Fate_Grand_Order__First_Order)

 [Moonlight/Lostroom](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36915/Fate_Grand_Order__Moonlight_Lostroom) and other upcoming titles spoil the later parts of the game and should not be watched without having played the Japanese version of F/GO.

**Fate/Prototype:**

Based on the original concept for the fate VNs, this is a short OVA with no real plot. Can be watched at any time.

**Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan:**

Slice of Life anime where the protagonist Emiya cooks and does other stuff.

**Fate/Extra:**

Fate/Extra is a series of games set in an alternate timeline. While the games themselves offer a brand new story that is several dozens of hours long, the current anime adaptation is in a very weird spot plot-wise. The orders are as follows:

* Games: Fate/Extra --> Fate/Extra CCC --> Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star


* Anime: [Fate/Extra Last Encore](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33047/Fate_Extra__Last_Encore) --> [Fate/Extra Last Encore - Irusterias Tendousetsu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37651/Fate_Extra__Last_Encore_-_Irusterias_Tendousetsu)

**Fate/Apocrypha:**

Yet another alternate timeline anime, this one is fully adapted and stands on its own pretty well. It is still recommended to watch it after finishing the main routes, for the basic knowledge on what a Holy Grail War is and what servants do.

**Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya:**

Fate... but with magical girls! Kaleid follows Illya von Einzbern, a key character from the main show, as a magical girl. It's a vastly different experience from all other Fate anime and it's the biggest Fate spin-off anime with over 40 episodes and several ^^^^^lewd OVAs, as well as a movie. The movie, despite being a prequel, is actually a bunch of flashbacks told in the last season so it's better to watch it at the end.

It's not a complete adaptation, there are rumors of a 4(5)th season being in production. It definitely should be watched after the original show, as there are some very interesting references later on that may count as spoilers for the main routes.

The order is as follows:

[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14829/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya) **-->** [ Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya: Undoukai de Dance!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18851/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya__Undoukai_de_Dance) **-->** [ Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Specials](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19109/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_Specials) **-->** [Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20509/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_2wei) **-->** [Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei!: Mahou Shoujo in Onsen Ryokou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/26057/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_2wei__Mahou_Shoujo_in_Onsen_Ryokou) **-->** [Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei!

Specials
](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33456/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_3rei_Specials) **-->** [Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Movie: Sekka no Chikai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34100/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_Movie__Sekka_no_Chikai) **-->** [Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Movie: Sekka no Chikai - Kuro Sakura no Heya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36833/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma%E2%98%86Illya_Movie__Sekka_no_Chikai_-_Kuro_Sakura_no_Heya)

**Lord El-Melloi II Case Files**

Case Files follows Velvet Waver from Fate/Zero in his adult years. There's currently an OVA out with an upcoming anime TV adaptation.

[Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Hakamori to Neko to Majutsushi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38936) -> [Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38959)
