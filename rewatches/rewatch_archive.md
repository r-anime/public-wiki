A resource for finding the threads for rewatches discussed on /r/anime. A work in progress, if you would like to report an error or want something to be added, please send a PM (Private Message on Reddit) to whoever was active most recently on the history tab for that year.

The archive is a collaborative effort, so it would also be extremely helpful if volunteering users could collect rewatch episode discussion threads for any current rewatches (which can be submitted at the end of the rewatch), or completed rewatches not already present in the wiki. If possible, please submit using a similar format to the one in use.
