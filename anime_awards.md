##Introduction  

The /r/Anime Awards are a community awards project run by volunteers from the Reddit /r/anime community. The awards are conceived on two main principles: involving the community as much as possible and giving each show the fair chance it deserves. Thus, each category has two distinct winners chosen separately by public vote and jury decision.  

The **public vote** is open to all members of the community. Anyone is eligible to vote and have their opinions counted towards the awards. Public vote is also responsible for selecting half the nominations.  

The **jury decision** is a result of a smaller group of voters after discussion and debate. Jurors are chosen from applicants within the community, and are obligated to watch each nomination in their assigned categories. The jury is also responsible for selecting the remaining nominations in each category.   

Please PM /u/MAD_SCIENTIST_001 if you notice any errors or have any suggestions!
