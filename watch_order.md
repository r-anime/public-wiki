## FAQ

### How can I add a watch order to this wiki?

PM /u/Gaporigo, /u/MAD_SCIENTIST_001, /u/Abyssbringer or send us a modmail with the series (and the watch order, preferably :P)

### How can I find a watch order that is not covered in this wiki?

AniDB has relations graphs on the pages of any anime with sequels/prequels etc. These can be useful for working out a watch order by yourself, however they're not always enough.

In addition to using AniDB, you can also use the relations sections on MyAnimeList (MAL) or Anilist to make an educated guess as to what the watch order is.

### What is a Director's Cut?

A directors cut is a special edition of an episode/film that portrays the directors original intent. A directors cut is usually longer, featuring scenes cut for runtime. They occasionally fill in plot holes or gaps in the narrative via character development or scene setting, generally making the media easier to understand, as well as in cases updating the graphics. However this is not always the case as some may just be plain filler.

### Should I watch a Director's cut?

If you don't mind spending a bit longer watching an anime, seek a 'fuller' experience or want to try it for a rewatch, a directors cut is for you. However if you are just a regular watcher, normal TV airing/Blu-ray editions work fine and don't really subtract anything from the viewing experience as you are unlikely to notice a difference (and you may prefer a more concise edition).

### What is Filler?

"Filler" refers to story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created because Anime production usually outpaces the Manga.

[Gintama](https://youtu.be/a4S9NuI6NKo) has a good explanation regarding filler.

### How can I find out whether an episode is filler or not?

### Berserk

Cheers to /u/Jumbledcode for this writeup.

The Berserk anime are adaptations of the classic dark fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura. The manga is still ongoing, and is the most complete way to experience Berserk, as all adaptations leave out some details, and none can match the quality of Miura's artwork.

So far the anime that have been produced are:

-   A 25-episode TV series made in 1997 entitled [Berserk](http://myanimelist.net/anime/33).

-   A set of three movies collectively titled _Berserk: The Golden Age_. Their subtitles are [Egg of the High King](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10218), [Battle for Doldrey](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12113), and [Descent](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12115).

-   A 12-episode TV series made in July of 2016, referred to as [Berserk (2016)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32379).

-   A 12-episode TV series made in April of 2017, referred to as [Berserk (2017)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34055), a sequel to Berserk (2016)

Both the 1997 series and the movies cover roughly the same material (the Golden Age arc), so viewers have a choice of possible watch orders.

**Option 1:** TV Series

[Berserk (1997)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/33) -> [Berserk (2016)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32379) -> [Berserk (2017)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34055)

The old series includes more material than the movies due to a longer total runtime, but omits a few characters who will become important in the latter series. It also has a stunning soundtrack created by Susumu Hirasawa. _Optional: Some fans advocate skipping the first episode of the old series and leaving it until last, as the main story of the old series is a flashback and the first episode takes place afterwards._

**Option 2:** Movies

[Berserk: The Golden Age I - Egg of the High King](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10218) -> [Berserk: The Golden Age II - Battle for Doldrey](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12113) -> [Berserk: The Golden Age III - Descent](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12115) -> [Berserk (2016)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32379) -> [Berserk (2017)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34055)

The movies were designed to precede the 2016 series, and cover the climax and aftermath of the Golden Age arc more completely than the old TV series does. However, the full CG used for them can be somewhat awkward-looking, especially for the first movie.

**Option 3:** Hybrid viewing

[Berserk (1997)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/33) episodes 2-20 -> [Berserk: The Golden Age III](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12115) - Descent -> [Berserk (2016)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32379) -> [Berserk (2017)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34055)

This order is for viewers who want both the extra detail of the series and the more complete climax and aftermath shown in the movie. The downside is that the two adaptations don't quite match up perfectly and the switch in styles may be jarring.

Please also note that there is a Berserk fanedit called Berserk Redux which many people consider the best way to watch it.

-   Digimon Adventure 02: Zenpen Digimon Hurricane Jouriku!! is considered non-canonical because of some events contradicting those of the series.

-   All the other season are considered spin-offs and there isn't that much of a connection besides a few digimon that reappear in the later parts. Any of these can be watched without the need of the movies.

### Dragon Ball

Before starting the Dragon Ball be sure to check the Notes and FAQ's sections at the bottom of this entry.

**Simple:**

[Dragon Ball [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/223) -> [Dragon Ball Z [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/813) OR [Dragon Ball Kai [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6033) -> [Dragon Ball Super [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30694) -> [Dragon Ball Super: Broly [Movie]](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/)

**Super Saiyan Mode:**

[Dragon Ball [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/223) -> [Dragon Ball Z Episodes 1-134 [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/813) OR [Dragon Ball Kai Episodes 1-65 [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6033) -> [Dragon Ball Z: History of Trunks [Movie]](https://myanimelist.net/anime/985/) -> [Dragon Ball Z Episodes 134-291 [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/813) OR [Dragon Ball Kai Episodes 66-167 [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6033) -> [Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods [Movie]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14837) -> [Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F [Movie]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25389) -> [Dragon Ball Super Episodes 28-131 [TV]](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30694) -> [Dragon Ball Super: Broly [Movie]](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36946/)

**Non-Canon:**

[Dragon Ball GT](http://myanimelist.net/anime/225) and [A Hero's Legacy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/987/)

Movies 1-17

[Bardock: the Father of Goku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/986)

[Episode of Bardock](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12231)

**Movie Order:**

[Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies](https://myanimelist.net/anime/502/) -> [Dragon Ball: Sleeping Princess in Devil’s Castle](https://myanimelist.net/anime/891/) -> [Dragon Ball Mystical Adventure](https://myanimelist.net/anime/892/)

The above three movies very loosely adapt the manga, and they have their own continuity. It is more of a companion piece and it is recommended to watch the first four arcs of Dragon Ball.

[Dragon Ball: The Path to Power](https://myanimelist.net/anime/893/) adapts the first three arcs of the Dragon Ball into one film. It is recommended to watch the first three sagas of dragon ball and later watch the movie.

[Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone](https://myanimelist.net/anime/894/) - Watch after the original Dragon Ball ends and before the Saiyan saga. Also, the villain comes back in the Z version filler episodes.

[Dragon Ball Z: The World’s Strongest](https://myanimelist.net/anime/895/) - Watch after Saiyan Saga in Kai and after episode 39 of Z.

[Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might](https://myanimelist.net/anime/896/) - Watch after episode 54 of Z and Kai episode 19.

[Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug](https://myanimelist.net/anime/897/) - Watch after episode 66 of Z and Kai episode 39. Also, this has is own version Super Saiyan transformation before the manga reveals what the transformation will look like.

[Dragon Ball Z: Cooler’s Revenge](https://myanimelist.net/anime/898/) - Watch after episode 99 of Z and Kai episode 50.

[Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler](https://myanimelist.net/anime/899/) - Watch after episode 130 of Z and Kai episode 63.

[Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/900/) - Watch after episode 146 of Z and Kai episode 72.

[Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/901/) takes place around after episode 176 of Z and Kai episode 87.

[Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound](https://myanimelist.net/anime/902/) takes after the Cell Saga.

[Dragon Ball Z: Broly – Second Coming](https://myanimelist.net/anime/903/) - Watch after episode 220 of Z and Kai episode 114.

[Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly](https://myanimelist.net/anime/904/) takes place after episode 232 of Z and kai episode 123.

[Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn](https://myanimelist.net/anime/905/) takes place after episode 258 of Z and Kai episode 144.

[Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of The Dragon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/906/) takes place after episode 270 and Kai episode 154.

The Broly movies in this list are non-canon. The new Broly movie is a re-imaging of the character and the newer version created by Toriyama.

**Note:**

-   Although it is possible to jump straight to Dragon Ball Z, it is highly encouraged to start with Dragon Ball because you start from the beginning. You see how characters meet and develop.

-   The first 27 episodes of Dragon Ball Super are recaps from the movies. They have some filler and expand on some lore from the film. Generally, it is recommended watching the movie because they have much higher production quality, the pacing is better since its 2 movies and not 27 episodes, and because the movies simply came first.

**FAQ's**

**What is the Difference between Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Kai?**

Dragon Ball Kai is remastered of Dragon Ball Z version that cuts some fillers to be closer to the manga. Both the Japanese and English recast some of the voice actors but they both kept the main ones. Kai version has new music, OP/ED sequences, sound effects, and HD video transfer.

**Why Aren't the Movies/GT Canon?**

Movies aren't canon because they conflict with the anime. This [Infograph](http://i.imgur.com/rsXt9.jpg) should help explaining things. They kinda exist in their own alternate reality.

GT and Hero Legacy isn’t canon because of Dragon Ball: Battle of Gods, Resurrection F, and Super tv-series change the story after the Buu saga. Akira Toriyama, the creator, didn’t write GT. It is optional if you want to watch it. The timeline of GT takes place after the Z/Kai ending. Hero Legacy is an epilogue and TV special to GT. It takes place at the ending of GT.

Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku got retconned in Dragon Ball Super Broly. Throughout the Frieze saga, this Bardock will show up in flashbacks. It is optional to watch and takes place after episode 86 in Z and episode 42 in Kai.

Episode Bardock isn't canon because it is a what if story not written by Toriyama.

###Eve no Jikan / Time of Eve

There are two versions of Eve no Jikan. One is [The ONA Series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3167) and the other is [The Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7465). The movie was released after the ONA, as a more definitive version of the ONA. The movie adds a few new scenes and fills out a few gaps, so unless you like watching episodic things, I would recommend watching the movie.

###Fate

The Fate franchise is sprawling with multiple unrelated spinoffs.

###Fist of the North Star / Hokuto no Ken

[Fist of the North Star](https://myanimelist.net/anime/967) -> [Fist of the North Star 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1356) -> [Shin Fist of the North Star](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1357)

**Optional:**

[Fist of the North Star: The Movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1358) adapts part of the first season.

[Hokuto no Ken: Raoh Gaiden Junai-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1773), [Hokuto no Ken: Raoh Gaiden Gekitou-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2174), [Hokuto no Ken: Yuria-den](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3027), [Hokuto no Ken: Toki-den](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4312) and [Hokuto no Ken Zero: Kenshirou Den](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5291) are remakes of the first season with a few alterations, these require knowledge from the TV series so they can't be watched on their own.

[DD Hokuto no Ken](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10177), [DD Hokuto no Ken \(2013\)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17705) and [DD Hokuto no Ken 2 Ichigo Aji+](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31018) are parody shorts.

[Souten no Ken](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1541) is set in the same world but completely standalone and separate from Hokuto no Ken, while [Souten no Ken: Regenesis](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36655) is its sequel but skips parts of the source material.

###Free!  

[Free!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18507) -> [Free!: Eternal Summer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22265) -> [High☆Speed!: Free! Starting Days](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30415) -> [Free!: Take Your Marks](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35198) -> [Free!: Dive to the Future](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36704) -> [Free!: Final Stroke Part 1 and 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38400/Free_Movie_4__The_Final_Stroke_-_Zenpen)

While Free! Starting Days is a prequel movie, it is necessary to watch before starting Free!:Dive to the Future. The two Free! recap movies (Timeless Medley 1: Kizuna, and Timeless Medley 2: Yakusoku) recap Eternal Summer, and are not required viewing. If you choose to watch them, however, do so after watching Free! Starting Days, and before Free! Dive to the Future, since there is some new content that includes characters from those two series. Free! Dive to the Future has a recap movie as well, it is called Free! Movie 3: Road to the World - Yume.

OVAs:

FrFr are a bunch of mini skits to be watched after Season 1 but are not required watching. 

[Eternal Summer's OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/26213/Free_Eternal_Summer__Kindan_no_All_Hard) is to be watched after S2 and before Take Your Marks, required watching.

[Dive to the Future OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38027/Free_Dive_to_the_Future_-_Soushun_no_Build-up) is to be watched after Take Your Marks and before Season 3, skippable but adds some context to season 3.

###Fullmetal Alchemist

[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114) -> [Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/121) (Optional) -> [Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa](http://myanimelist.net/anime/430) (Direct Sequel to Fullmetal Alchemist 2003)

**Fullmetal Alchemist** and **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** are based on the same manga, both beginning from the start of the manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was made first, and because it was made very early in the manga’s story, it has a fair amount of anime original content, and an anime original ending. While it came out later, Brotherhood is **not** a sequel to the 2003 anime.

Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is generally regarded as better than Full Metal Alchemist, and it stays faithful to the manga. You can watch Full Metal Alchemist without watching Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and vice versa, but if you're watching **both**, the order above is recommended. 

Each anime is it’s own entity, and the 2003 incarnation begins diverging from the manga’s story as early as the second episode. The ending is anime original, and was designed as such from the beginning. Brotherhood does not have any expectation that viewers have seen the original anime.

There's also the movie [Sacred Star of Milos](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9135) which can be watched after **Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood**, but is completely optional.

###Ghost In the Shell
There are currently three Ghost in the Shell timelines:

1. Ghost in the Shell (Movies)

2. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex

3. Ghost in the Shell: Arise

These are all separate continuities and do not have any relations with one another and can be viewed independently. However, the original movie introduces concepts which will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the other installments. As such, it is recommended that you watch the 1995 movie first.


**Ghost in the Shell (Movies)**

*Looking for something that places a heavy focus on philosophical intrigue (i.e. "What does it mean to be alive?") in a gritty cyberpunk setting?* The original movies are your best starting point:

[Ghost in the Shell (1995)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/43) -> [Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence](http://myanimelist.net/anime/468)

Note: Do not bother watching [Ghost in the Shell 2.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4672). It is an inferior looking remake to the original 1995 version that replaces some scenes with extremely ugly and dated CGI visuals. Just stick with the 1995 version.

**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**

*Want a procedural cop drama that is set in a futuristic sci-fi cyberpunk world that focuses more on world building and characterization while having philosophy and social theory play an important role in the series itself?* The Stand Alone Complex timeline would be for you:

[GitS: SAC](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467) -> [GitS: SAC 2nd GIG](http://myanimelist.net/anime/801) -> [GitS: SAC - Solid State Society](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1566)

There are also summary movies that focuses only on the overarching case in each SAC season:

[GitS: SAC - The Laughing Man](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2449) is a summary of the Laughing Man case of SAC.

[GitS: SAC - Individual Eleven](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2448) is a summary of the Individual Eleven case in SAC 2nd gig.

These are generally meant to be watched after their respective seasons if you want to see the overarching case without any breaks for stand alone episodes as well as some extra scenes. 

There are also specials associated with each SAC season. [SAC - Tachikoma na Hibi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1335) and [SAC 2nd GIG - Tachikoma na Hibi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3485) which are short 1 minute specials for every episode. They are not mandatory for viewing and are comedic shorts involving some of the characters from SAC. 

**Ghost in the Shell: Arise**

The third timeline, Arise is generally not recommended for first viewing. This is because to its detriment, it focuses primarily on action while ditching a lot of the philosophical aspects. It was meant to be a reboot of the series to tell the story of the creation Section 9 and some of the characters in their early days. *If you just want to see well animated action scenes in a cool looking sci-fi world, you can start here*. The Arise timeline consists of 4 OVAs, a movie and a TV series. This is the proper watch order:

1. [Ghost Pain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17187)

2. [Ghost Whispers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19191)

3. [Ghost Tears](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19193)

4. [Ghost Stands alone](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19195)

5. [GitS: Arise - Alternative Architecture TV series episode 9 and 10](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29325)*

6. [Ghost in the Shell (2015)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27411)

*The Arise Architecture TV series is simply a compilation of the OVA in a different order for episodes 1-8. The new content begins in episode 9 and 10 which connects the OVAs with the 2015 movie.

###Gundam

**Mobile Suit Gundam**

*Original draft by /u/wingsoflight. Rewritten for 2018~2019 by /u/RX-Nota-II*. Updates for 2022 by u/Mistigrum and u/Abyssbringer.

Gundam is a very broad and branching franchise that may seem intimidating to find a place to start. However with a quick overview of show types and continuity the picture becomes much clearer. 

***Timelines and Continuity***

In short there are three types of Gundam anime: Mainline Universal Century (UC), Universal Century spinoffs, and Independent works. The Mainline UC works are the long connected narrative that most defines Gundam as a franchise with important watch order detailed below. Universal Century spinoffs often make references to events in mainline UC but have self contained stories that can be enjoyed with little background necessary. Finally independent works, often grouped as Alternate Universe (AU) works by the fanbase, have no connection at all to other entries (with few exceptions) and can be enjoyed completely on their own. 

[Here is a visual representation of Gundam anime sorted into these categories](https://files.catbox.moe/1n305r.png)

For more details on each category please look ahead to their sections bolded below.

***Entry Points:***

There is no real absolute correct way to start Gundam. They all have their own pros and cons. I will breakdown them into the 3 most recommended ways to start with a few variations for each so you can decide which one to start with.

**Mainline UC Route (most recommended):**

- The best way to start is none other than with the original [Mobile Suit Gundam (0079)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/80/) (43 ep). This is the first Gundam anime and is considered to be an alltime classic. Most other Gundams, even AUs, either pay homage or derive a lot of ideas from the original. Because the series began in 1979 the visuals and pacing are quite dated and could be off putting to those who prefer a modern presentation. A trilogy [Movie summary](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1090/) exists which updates the graphics and tightens up the pacing significantly. However the movies sacrifice a lot of characterization that comes from the TV series and it is still recommended to start with the TV version if you can. Another point to make is that you should also considering watching the third summary movie, [Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1092/), even if you have watched the TV version. The reason for this is because the third movie "fixes" the ending of 0079 to make it more canon with the rest of UC. While not crucial, you will only benefit from watching the third movie summary moving ahead to other UC entries.
- The only other entry point for mainline UC, [Gundam Unicorn](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6336/), is much less recommended by the fanbase but is the primary method being pushed by the creators Bandai-Sunrise right now. As a 7 movie epic taking between 2009 and 2014 to make, it showcases the pinnacle of Sunrise’s production skill and presentation. Strong factors leading to its recommendation include wide legal availability online through Youtube and Netflix. However, while it is designed to allow for first timers to understand, it is also a direct sequel to 4 other past Gundams with many important references that simply have to be put aside for later if you have not seen them before. Even so, for someone looking for a visual spectacle that follows the legendary UC timeline but not yet interested in starting from the beginning, I do believe it’s a solid entry to consider. If interested definitely check out the dedicated footnote near the end of this writeup


**AU Series route (second most recommended):**

- If you much prefer the visuals, presentation, and overall style of modern anime, the independent ‘AU’ works will suit you well as an introduction to Gundam’s main themes and ideas. Two AUs that serve as good entry points are Gundam 00 and Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans.
- [00 (50ep + movie)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2581/) is a much more action heavy series with a focus on geopolitics. The plot of the show is fairly unique and does takes a multi-perspective view point of all the different sides of the conflict similar to say Fate/Zero or Game of Thrones. For those who want a Gundam show with a good amount of mechs fighting and seeing the escalation of warfare and how it affects the world, give this series a shot.
- [Iron-blooded Orphans (50ep)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31251/). is a much more slower show compared to other entries both in pacing and action. It has much less mecha fighting and places a higher focus on slice of life character interactions between the crew. While its writing may suffer from a lack of subtlety, those who are looking for a full length show with less mechs fighting should give this a watch.
- (Specialized start place. Less recommended) [Build Fighters (25 ep)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319/) is perhaps the most unique Gundam show as it is a shounen sports tournament style show set in our real world, focusing on magical plastic model toys rather than show detailing war and conflict. It is a fantastic series with extremely hype action and pretty much an all around likable cast of characters. The show can be best compared to the original Beyblade as it carries a similar concept, or My Hero Academia as much of the staff for Build Fighters went on to work on that show in a similar style as well. While you certainly benefit from having seen all the other Gundam entries as there are countless AMAZING easter eggs and references for long term fans, it is not necessary to enjoy the show. If you want a pure time, light hearted show that also manages to have some amazing fight choreography Build Fighters is a great show to watch.


**UC Spinoff route (Very doable and enjoyable but least recommended)**

*While these entries present self contained stories, they are set within the context of the Universal Century, and can be understood much easier having seen mainline UC shows or even just 0079. While not often recommended as entry points into the franchise, they have worked very well as such for many in the past.*

- [0080: War in the Pocket](http://myanimelist.net/anime/82/) is a fantastic short (6 episodes long) OVA series that takes the perspective of a civilian kid during the final months of 0079. It tells a story detailing both the tragedy and futility of war and conflict without having to rely on a lot of mecha battles to do so. If you are not too big of a fan of mecha in general or you liked Grave of the Fireflies, this is a great place to start as it is one of the best entries in the Gundam franchise.
- [The 08th MS Team](http://myanimelist.net/anime/81/) is a 12 episode OVA series that takes place during the events of 0079 from the viewpoint of normal soldiers rather than ace pilots. It has a very Vietnam War type jungle setting and one of the more down to earth Gundam entries. It also has this Romeo and Juliet romance subplot which it pulls off with varying degrees of success. If you want a shorter Gundam series with plenty of action, start here.
- [Thunderbolt](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31973/) is a very short entry (two movies of a bit over an hour each), but pulls off a very gritty and dark atmosphere that does an exceptional job of both morally grey the conflict on both sides and showcasing the horrors and tragedy of war all while having a fantastic jazz soundtrack. To date it is the best looking Gundam series. It does however suffer from some pacing issues towards the second half. For those who want a very short but great watch, check out Thunderbolt. It is also recommended to read this quick post to contextualize the events of where Thunderbolt takes place. 

**Watch Order** 

As stated above, ‘AU’ independent works can be watched in any order as you please. Mainline UC on the other hand requires plenty of sequential context and it is STRONGLY recommended that one follows the order detailed below. Spinoff UC has varying levels of required context also detailed below per show. 

If you are a completionist, [/m/'s guide](http://i.imgur.com/Dwln3Im.jpg) from the top left to the right provides a good roadmap through every entry UC and AU up to 2015. The /m/ guide does a good job of listing the pros and cons of each series so you can also use that to evaluate what you want to see.

***Universal Century recommended Order***

This watch order is contextualized production order. The reason for this is to both showcase how Gundam was originally meant to be seen (production order), but also includes entries which are relevant to Early UC together so one does not have to skip to a different time period/timeline. Mainline are bold, Spinoffs are italic.

*OVAs with special requirements:*

- Origin: 0079 is required to be viewed first and watching Origin first may spoil certain key plots of 0079. Watching all other previously released UC is also highly recommended.
- MS IGLOO: 0079 is needed.
- 0083: 0079 is needed as a minimum. It is also recommended that Zeta be watched first as well, but not a 100% required. See dedicated footnote for more info.
- Unicorn: 0079, Zeta, ZZ and CCA recommended. See dedicated footnote.
- Twilight Axis: 0079 required
- Cucuruz Doan's Island: 0079 required; follows the order of events from Origin but doesn't directly reference it.

*Late UC*

Although this is still part of the Universal Century timeline, the events happen so far into the future that they can be viewed without early UC knowledge. Some recommend that you watch ‘early’ UC (all shows in the section immediately above) first as it will much more easily get you used to the director Yoshiyuki Tomino’s unique style but otherwise there is little factual knowledge that you will miss by going into these entries blind.

***Special Notes Footnote for shows with asterisks from above***

***Turn A Gundam and Correct Century***

[Turn A Gundam](http://myanimelist.net/anime/95/) is a special entry as it is technically an AU series but at the same time it also belongs with Late UC as it takes place very far into the future and also has multiple different timelines converging on it. While perfectly enjoyable standalone, it is highly recommended to have seen almost everything aired before Turn-A (anything pre 2000) which means both early and late UC series along with the AU timelines Future Colony (G), After Colony (Wing) and After War (After War X). 

***ZZ Gundam***

ZZ Gundam also needs special mention because of how radically different it is from its direct predecessor Zeta in terms of tone and atmosphere. Whereas Zeta was a lot more depressing and grimmer, ZZ is a very light hearted in stark contrast (at least in the beginning). It does however get a lot more serious and darker as the show progresses if you are feeling uneasy with the change of pace. There are some opinions to skip this entry in the mainline UC timeline but this is HIGHLY NOT recommended as the events for this show are crucial to fully understanding the highly acclaimed successors CCA and Unicorn. Episode 1 of ZZ is basically recap and skippable.
 
***0083 Stardust Memory***

0083 is a special case in that it takes place between the large time period between 0079 and Zeta. There are merits to watching it before and after Zeta. Watching it before Zeta will explain how the creation of the major antagonist of Zeta was formed and in general answer questions one might have in Zeta from the time of 0079. However watching 0083 also does take away some of the experience on the emotional side and the shift in animation from 0079 -> 0083 -> Zeta is a bit jarring. I would still highly recommend watching it after Zeta rather than before as 0083 more or less serves the purpose of answering questions left unanswered in Zeta rather than be a required entry. 

***Gundam Unicorn***

As said above, Gundam Unicorn functions both as a direct sequel to Char’s Counterattack as the 5th entry in the mainline UC timeline as well as a modern place that the creators Bandai-Sunrise have declared as a possible entry for the franchise. Two important questions I will address are: Can I watch this show as an entry into UC and Which version should I watch?

About watching as an entry into UC the answer is ‘probably not’. While Unicorn does an okay job of trying to introduce new viewers into Gundam, it is highly recommended that you watch the core of early UC (The core includes 0079, Zeta, ZZ and CCA) first. The core is required to fully understand Unicorn as a lot of character motivations, politics and even the ending heavily rely on developments made in those previous works. However all of the main characters and their stories are self-contained within Unicorn, and the protagonist provides a great standin for those suddenly thrown into the fray with no prior knowledge himself of the previous works’ events. If you have the time and ability to watch the previous early UC core, that remains the more enjoyable route overall. However if you are unable to enjoy the quite classic approach those 80’s era works take, or want to stay with what’s easily available on Youtube and Netflix, starting with Unicorn should still be a great experience.

Next up is ‘which version should I watch’ since there are 2 different packages Unicorn comes in. They are: 
    
- [Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6336/): A movie or OVA series based on 6 one hour long OVAs and a seventh 90 minute OVA. The original version released from 2010~2014. Has no Opening theme and 7 different ED themes. This is the version found on Netflix.
- [Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:0096](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32792/) is a rebroadcasting of the original OVA into a TV format of 22 standard length episodes with a decently sized recap segment before every episode narrated by the VA for the main villain. This is the version found on Youtube.

It is definitely recommended to watch the 7 part OVA/movie presentation of Unicorn over 0096. The original story was created to fit the OVA format and ported to TV blocks results in plenty of strange breaks as well as iffy pacing especially near the beginning. Further the visuals used in the opening and ending for 0096 are chock full of massive spoilers. However, there is one single advantage 0096 does offer, which is the summary narrations at the beginning of the episode. Unicorn can be quite dense and hard to understand even for those who have seen all the prerequisites and for them listening to a brief summary of what has happened up to that point can be very useful. So in conclusion definitely try out the OVA version first and switch over to 0096 only when things become too confusing even after trying to rewatch the bits that initially got you stuck.

***Movie Summaries***

In general, avoid movie summaries until after you have seen the series. (Zeta's summary A New Translation especially should not be watched first as it retcons the rest of UC). The only movie summary that can serve as the replacement for the series is the 0079 movies.

###Hellsing

There are two seperate versions of Hellsing:

[Hellsing (2001)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/270) is the original series. It was adapted before the manga was completed and has an anime original second half. It is the more serious of the two with a highly praised style and better animation, but the ending has been heavily criticized and it's widely considered the inferior story.

[Hellsing Ultimate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/777) is a full adaption of the manga storyline, released as ten 1-hour OVAs. It also has a special episode, [Hellsing: The Dawn](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11077) to be watched after the main series. Ultimate has a grander story and significantly better ending and overall art quality, but equally splits the horror with chibi comedy which may not suit everyone.

The two versions are completely independent and you do not have to watch one to understand the other.

Euphonium Movie 3: Chikai no Finale](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35678)  

The first movie is a recap of the first season, and isn't really worth watching besides one of the performances being extended. The second movie does have a few new scenes added but it is ultimately just a recap of the second season. The third movie is a sequel and should be watched after season 2.

[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934) -> [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Spe­cial: Nekogoroshi-hen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2899) (optional) -> [Higur­ashi no Naku Koro ni Kai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1889) -> [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3652) (optional) -> [Higur­ashi no Naku Koro ni Kira](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10491) (optional) -> [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16700) (optional) -> [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41006/) -> [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/48488/)

If you're not interested in the comedic episodes of Higurashi and don't like fanservice - don't watch Kira. It will disappoint you.

###Hunter X Hunter

[Hunter X Hunter (2011)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061) is the newer version. The newer version covers all of the material the old version/OVA covers, **plus more.** Everything from episode 75 of the 2011 version is not covered by the old version. As such, the 2011 version is widely regarded as a better adaptation.

The two movies [Phantom Rouge](https://myanimelist.net/anime/13271) and [The Last Mission](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19951) are both standalone stories that are non canon. However if you want to keep them relatively chronological; the first should be watched after Yorknew before Greed, and the second sometime before Chimera.

The 1999 adaptation is split up into three entries. The OVA's are required and should be watched in the order listed below. We reccomend watching this adaptation if you have already seen the 2011 version as that version covers more. The adaptations are very different style and pacing wise and both worth watching for fans of HXH.

[Hunter X Hunter (1999)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/136) -> [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/137) -> [Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island](https://myanimelist.net/anime/138/Hunter_x_Hunter__Greed_Island)

###The iDOLM@STER / IDOLMASTER

Main series: 

[The iDOLM@STER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10278) > [Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11889) > [Shiny Festa OVAs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14835) > [iDOLM@STER Movie: Beyond the Brilliant Future](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17437) > [The iDOLM@STER SideM Prologue](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36186) > [The iDOLM@STER SideM](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34915)

Spin offs should always be watched after the main series. Otherwise no particular order is necessary. The most notable of which being [The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23587) and its [second season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30344).

[iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1694) is an optional watch as it's a mecha show that is mostly unrelated to the main series.

###Inuyasha

[Inuyasha](https://myanimelist.net/anime/249) -> [InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6811)

There are four side story films that are optional and do not affect the main plot of the series.  Their approximate chronological placement with the main series is as follows:

Episodes 1-54 ->
[Movie 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/452) ->
Episodes 55-95 ->
[Movie 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/450) ->
Episodes 96-136 ->
[Movie 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/451) ->
Episodes 137-167 ->
[Movie 4](https://myanimelist.net/anime/449)

###Initial D

[First stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/185) -> [Second Stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/186) -> [Third stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/187) (movie) -> [Fourth Stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18) -> [Fifth stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15059) -> [Final Stage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22507)


[Extra Stage 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/822) + [Extra Stage 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5228/Initial_D_Extra_Stage_2): Focuses on two side characters from the main series and is skippable. They aren't filler and a good watch if you are interested in the romance side of the series. Watch after Second Stage.



**Battle Stages**: Compilation movies of the races from the main series. Includes some updated animation and new music. Pretty much a long AMV and reccomened if you want to sit back and listen to new eurobeat. Not required in the least.

* [Battle Stage 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/821/Initial_D_Battle_Stage?q=battle%20stage&cat=anime): After Third Stage
* [Battle Stage 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3931/Initial_D_Battle_Stage_2): After Fourth Stage
* [Battle Stage 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47410/Initial_D_Battle_Stage_3): After Final Stage



[New Initial D](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19613): Movie trilogy that retells some events from First Stage. Features great animation, but lacks the bitching soundtrack that marked previous installments. It's an entirely new continuity. Only reccomend to viewers who have already watched Initial D. It cuts out a bunch of details, characers development, and races.

###JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14719) -> [JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stardust Crusaders](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20899) -> [JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stardust Crusaders Season 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26055) - > [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31933) -> [Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33191) (optional) -> [JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Ougon no Kaze](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37991) 

The Phantom Blood movie and the OVA series are alternate versions of 2012 and Stardust Crusaders and can therefore be skipped in favour of the David Productions anime series.

For the OVA series:

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2000)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/665) -->  [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/666)

This seems backwards, and that's because it is. But this series isn't normal to begin with.

[Phantom Blood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3603) is the theatrical movie that covers the events of the beginning of 2012, but it was so poorly received by fans and the mangaka himself that it was cancelled and was never released on home video, so it cannot be found online.


---  

###K  

The show should be watched in release order, which is the following:

[K](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14467) > [K: Missing Kings](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16904) > [K: Return of Kings](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27991) > K: Seven Stories Movies (in order - [R:B](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33248) > [Side:Blue](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37303) > [Side:Green](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37304) > [Lost Small Word](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37305) > [Memories of Red](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37306) > [Circle Vision](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37307) )

All the Seven Stories movies contain either characters or reference events that are spoilers for K: Missing Kings and K: Return of Kings and should not be watched before finishing them. The start of each Seven Stories movie also contains a short clip of an idol spinoff containing K characters. Two of the Seven Stories movies are incomplete adaptions:

- Seven Stories: Lost Small World movie only adapts the first two thirds of the original source and does not contain the final part of the [LN](https://myanimelist.net/manga/69399/)/[Manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/73451/) which is arguably the most important. 

- Seven Stories: Memories of Red only adapts the final chapter of the [source manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/41435/) which is a compilation of various stories of HOMRA.

The other LN and manga stories in the series can all be read between K and Missing Kings. Days of Blue manga has sequel chapters to both Side:Blue (movie or LN) and to an unadapted chapter of the Memories of Red manga but the other side stories are not directly connected and each story can be read independently.  

For rewatchers who wish to watch the series in chronological order, its the following:

[Seven Stories 4: Lost Small Word](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37305) > [Seven Stories 1: R:B](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33248) > [Seven Stories 2: Side:Blue](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37303) > [Seven Stories 3: Side:Green](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37304) > [Seven Stories 5: Memories of Red](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37306) > [K](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14467) > [K: Missing Kings](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16904) > [K: Return of Kings](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27991) > [Seven Stories 6: Circle Vision](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37307)

###Kino's Journey

[The spinoff movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2175) and [Life Goes On](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1379) should be watched after you have completed the [main series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/486). While Life Goes On is technically a prequel it spoils important reveals for the series. [Kino's Journey - The Animated Series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35079) is remake of the original anime and adapts different chapters so it can be watched independently of the rest of the series.

###Kuroko no Basuke

[Kuroko no Basuke season 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11771) episodes 1-13 -> [Baka ja Katenai no yo!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19669) -> Season 1 episodes 14-22 -> [Tip Off](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16916) -> Season 1 episodes 23+ -> [Oshaberi Shiyokka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17259) -> [NG-shuu season 1 bloopers](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15487)

###Kyoukai no Kanata  
  
[Kyoukai no Kanata](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18153) > [Shinonome](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23385) (OPTIONAL) > [Kako-Hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25015) (OPTIONAL) > [Mirai-Hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28675)     
  
Shinonome is a prequel OVA which is best left for after the original series. Kako-Hen is a recap of the original series with some bonus footage, though some content in its ending adds a decent amount of context to Mirai-Hen. The other Kyoukai no Kanata specials (Mini-theatre, Idol Saiban, etc) are all non-canon and can be watched at any point after the series. 

---

###Kyousougiga

[Kyousougiga (TV)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703) -> [Kyousougiga OVA (OPTIONAL)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10893) -> [Kyousougiga ONA (2012) (OPTIONAL)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15359)

The OVA and the ONA series are entirely optional, because they're re-told in the TV version anyway. You can watch them if you want more Kyousougiga, but they're not required. Similarly, you don't *need* to watch 'Episode 0' of the TV series if you don't want to.

###Legend of the Galactic Heroes

(Special thanks to /u/Nazenn for this watch order)

[Full watch order infographic](https://i.imgur.com/2kpRjoD.png). Includes extended information about each entry and its watch order.

[Condensed infographic](https://i.imgur.com/Oer57zh.png) for easy reference 

There are two versions of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, the original 80-90's adaption and a new adaption started in 2018. 

While either will get you the core story and it comes down to preference, for people looking to only watch one version the current recommendation is the original adaption due to a better narrative structure, less generic character designs and more in depth narration and character details.

**Original Series**

[My Conquest is the Sea Of Stars](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3014) -> [Overture to a New War*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3016) -> [Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA series)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820) -> Gaiden**: [A Hundred Billion Stars](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3371) & [Spiral Labyrinth](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3665) 

*Overture to a New War replaces the first two episodes of the main OVA. It's an expanded movie version of those events.

**Gaiden should be watched chronologically which can be a little unintuitive: 

Spiral Labyrinth (1999 series) episodes 1-14 -> A Hundred Billion Stars (1998 series) episodes 1-4 -> Spiral Labyrinth eps 15-26 -> A Hundred Billion Stars eps 5-8 -> Spiral Labyrinth eps 27-28 -> A Hundred Billion Stars eps 13-24 -> A Hundred Billion Stars eps 9-12 (HiDive has these in the correct order)

This watch order covers all of the material from the original adaption of LotGH covering the main story and the Gaiden prequels. For first timers Gaiden should be watched after the main story because it heavily references events from it.

**Readaption: Die Neue These**

[Kaikou/season 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31433) -> [Seiran movie 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36369) - > [Seiran movie 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36370) -> [Seiran movie 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36371)

Seiran was originally aired as three movies, but western releases split each movie into four episodes and aired it as a twelve episode anime series instead.

The readaption currently only covers up to episode 26 of the original series. 

Due to some adaption differences it's not recommended to use this as an alternative to the start of the original series.

###Little Witch Academia  
  
[Little Witch Academia (Movie)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14349) -> [Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19489)  
  
[Little Witch Academia (TV)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33489) exists in an entirely seperate continuity from the films and can be watched by itself, before, or after the movies.  
  
---  

###Love Hina

[Love Hina](http://myanimelist.net/anime/189) (Episodes 1-24) ->  [Love Hina: Motoko no Sentaku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/963) (also known as Episode 25) -> [Love Hina Christmas Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/191) -> [Love Hina Haru Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/192) -> [Love Hina Again](http://myanimelist.net/anime/190) 

Also, [Love Hina Final Selection](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3247) is just a summary of the main series plot (mostly composed of chapter 24). Love Hina Again is the one that serves as a closure of the series, not this one.

###Love Live

[Love Live! School Idol Project](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15051) -> [Love Live! School Idol Project OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20745) -> [Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19111) -> [Love Live! The School Idol Movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/24997) -> [Love Live! Sunshine!!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32526) -> [Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34973) -> [Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37027)

Important notes:

- Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place a few years after the original series, Love Live! School Idol Project. While Love Live! Sunshine!! works as an acceptable entry point into the franchise, you will be left out of the loop concerning why a particular idol group is so revered amongst the main characters of the series. **Thus, it is *highly recommended* that you watch the original series first.**

- The events of the [OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20745) is slightly confusing and contains no major plot points that makes it a required viewing prior to watching the second season. It is not absolutely necessary to watch, buy if you have time, it is only 10 minutes and focuses on Maki so you might as well. It's just an extended music video packaged as an OVA.

- The music videos for Love Live! School Idol Project are not necessary to watch since they are just music videos and contain no plot. If you want you can watch all of them after season 1 *except* Snow Halation which should be watched after season 2. They are listed below in release order: 

 - [Bokura no Live Kimi to no Life](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9907)

 - [Snow Halation](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9930) 

 - [Natsu-iro Egao de 1, 2, Jump!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11033) 

 - [Mo Gyutto Love de Sekkinchuu!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12637)

 - [Wonderful Rush](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14951) 

 - [Music S.T.A.R.T!!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20877)

 - [A song for You! You? You!!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41319)

- Similarly, the music videos for Love Live! Sunshine!! follow same rhetoric as the original's; no major plot points and can be watched prior to viewing of the series. They are listed below in release order:

###Lupin III

The various entries are only related episodically, therefore one may start at any given point although some might demand a bit more familiarity with the core cast than others. For a comprehensive guide on where to start and which entries to prioritize, check out [this WT!](/6hoqpu) (cheers to /u/Thrasher439).

###Macross
 
Cheers to /u/chilidirigible for this writeup.

**TL;DR:** Each *Macross* entry can be viewed individually, and most series start with prologue narration sufficient to bring a viewer up to speed enough that they won't feel totally lost, and any *required* background is usually explained as they go along.  Already having knowledge of past series will definitely enhance one's appreciation of any individual entry, though.  To that end, here is:
 
**A Short Guide to the** ***Macross*** **Franchise**
 
*Macross* is a long runner, initially proposed in 1980 as a *comedic* response to series such as *Mobile Suit Gundam*, but developing both serious and unique ideas of its own as it reached release. Its core thematic elements are: A war or conflict, featuring transforming mecha; a love story, often involving some triangular aspect; and music, as a force for cultural change.  The ratio of these three elements varies within each entry in the franchise. (Alternatively, in official statements, [Variable Fighters, Love, and Music.](https://imgur.com/9JjxGPz))

Music is of particular importance, as it serves as a counterpoint to the conflicts in the series, demonstrating how culture (which includes music, love, and other human interactions), can influence societies that otherwise lack a middle ground.  *Macross*'s emphasis on and interdependence with music is what set it apart from its contemporaries in 1982, and is still notable a generation later.  The music in the series typically follows the trends of Japanese music at the time of production, and has thus included such varied forms as '80s pop, rock, *Macross Plus*, and the idol phenomenon. *There is always going to be music.*
 
Continuity and watching out of sequence: [It was once claimed by series creator Shoji Kawamori that each series could be considered in-universe dramatizations of the actual events, a statement which handwaved away various canon and continuity vagueness.](https://www.decultureshock.com/shoji-kawamori-on-what-is-and-what-is-not-canon/) He has also suggested that the series are more like documentaries and the movie versions are hyped-up dramatizations. In *Macross 7* and *Macross Frontier* the characters are seen making theatrical versions of *other series in the franchise*, further complicating matters. In any case, don't worry too much if you've missed one of the series or are starting out at an arbitrary point, it will still all fit together.
 
**Broadcast/OVA/theatrical content, major entries in bold:**
 
[***Super Dimension Fortress Macross***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1088): Aired 1982-1983, 36 episodes. Timeline: 2009-2012. Depicts the first contact between humanity and the aliens known as the Zentradi, the resulting conflict, and its aftermath.
 
[***Macross: Do You Remember Love?***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1089): Premiered in 1984. Two-hour film reinterpretation of SDFM. Squeezes the story down to the essentials but also changes how some events occur.  *If you're pressed for time, it's a good way to learn the basics of the first series at an obvious cost to background details and subplots.*  **However**, it is *best* viewed as a companion piece to SDFM; DYRL's interpretation of events is made much richer if one views it with an understanding of what came first.
 
[*Macross: Flashback 2012*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1504): Released in 1987. Thirty-minute music video collection of songs/clips from both SDFM and DYRL framed by a few minutes of new footage. Most notable for the ending, which contains an event which was cut for time from both the original series and the film.
 
[***Macross Plus***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/474): Released in 1994, four-episode OVA. Timeline: 2040. The most focused and self-contained entry in the franchise: UN Spacy is conducting flight trials to select its next-generation Variable Fighter, and the finalists are piloted by two old rivals with axes to grind both in the air and on the ground.  In between is their old flame and the artificially-intelligent holographic idol whom she manages.   Backed by an impressive production pedigree which includes co-direction by Shinichiro Watanabe and music by Yoko Kanno. The best hand-drawn action in the franchise. Also available as:
 
[*Macross Plus Movie Edition*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1211): Released in 1995. A theatrically-edited version of the OVA to fit movie length. A few scenes are lost, a few scenes are moved around, and the climax gains extra footage. Unlike DYRL, though, it's a very close match between this and the OVA.
 
[***Macross 7***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1397): Aired 1994-1995, 49 episodes. Timeline: 2045-2046.  *Macross*'s first presentation of the long-term project to preserve humanity by spreading it across the galaxy.  An ancient and powerful enemy soon appears, but while the Macross 7 fleet includes some of the greatest pilots in the galaxy, their greatest advantage over this apocalyptic threat turns out to be the power of [ROCK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFJbIAAYQx8).
This series is *much* less serious than the other franchise entries, padded out with subplots, and very controversial within the Western fanbase, but it is *extremely* popular in Japan.  Goofy as it may seem at times, it's pure in its intentions and the soundtrack is worth a listen on its own.
 
[*Macross 7: Encore*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1399); [*Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy's Calling Me!*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1400); [*Macross Dynamite 7*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1398): Befitting *7*'s aforementioned Japanese popularity, it has several supplemental entries. The first two are extra episodes and side stories set during the series timeline, the last is a follow-up.
 
[***Macross Zero***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/194): Released in 2002, five-episode OVA. Timeline: 2008. Prequel depicting the final battles of Earth's Unification War, which soon involve civilians and alien artifacts.  For a *Macross* entry, it has the greatest emphasis on combat and significantly less character story or music, and the darkest tone in the franchise (which is still not very dark).  First major use of CG for the combat sequences, but it still looks decent enough as it has aged. While generally a placeholder to get something on the market after a multiyear drought, concepts first seen here would take on greater significance in the later sequels.
 
[***Macross Frontier***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3572): Aired 2008, 25 episodes. Timeline: 2059.  Full series set on another colonization fleet, which, as usual, encounters an unknown and hostile alien species.  *Frontier* features slightly younger main characters and a more slice-of-life feel, though the space setting is always present and it is by no means a light and fluffy series. Musically, it has another fantastic soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, and uses it to great advantage by featuring two main singers. Released for the *Macross* franchise's 25th anniversary, *Frontier* includes references and homages to everything that came before it, especially SDFM, enough so that it is a good gateway series to the franchise in its own right, particularly if watching something from 1983 would give you culture shock. To *fully appreciate* the references the rest still needs to be seen.
 
[*Macross Frontier: Itsuwari no Utahime*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5310) (2009) and [*Macross Frontier: Sayonara no Tsubasa*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7222) (2011): Movie adaptations of *Frontier*. Like DYRL did before them, the adaptations alter various parts of *Frontier* while also trimming the series for length.  *Sayonara no Tsubasa* diverges from its parent series almost as much as DYRL did, but then delivers quite an ending.
 
[*Macross FB 7: Ore no Uta wo Kike!*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15177): Premiered in 2012. Essentially a *Macross 7* clip show/Blu-ray advertisement at feature-film length, rather than a true abridgement of M7. Short new scenes with the *Frontier* characters serve as a framing device. The ED songs are catchy, at least.
 
[***Macross Delta***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28013): Aired 2016, 26 episodes. Timeline: 2067. A condition called Vár Syndrome is affecting the galaxy, but it can be countered by certain singers. The series follows the Var-countering "tactical idol" group known as Walküre and its partners in the Delta Variable Fighter squadron, as a larger conflict emerges from a galactic backwater. Like *7* before it, *Delta* split the Western fanbase due to its emphasis on the musical performances over the transforming mecha combat. But in 2016, idols were everywhere.

[*Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36077): Premiered in 2018. The *Delta* movie compresses Walküre's storyline from the series into a two-hour movie, losing several side plots (for better or for worse) and altering a few characterizations. It was produced in a very short time by re-using many animation assets from the series and reassembling them to fit the adapted storyline.
 
[***Macross Δ Movie 2: Zettai LIVE!!!!!!***](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38373/Macross_%CE%94_Movie_2__Zettai_Live): Premiered October 2021. *Delta*'s second theatrical release is a continuation of the storyline from the first movie, making it the rare *Macross* sequel via movie instead of TV. Was accompanied by the the *Macross Frontier* short film/music video [*The Labyrinth of Time*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47409/Gekijou_Tanpen_Macross_Frontier__Toki_no_Meikyuu).

 
One more thing:

***[Macross II: Lovers Again](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1262)***: Released in 1992, 6-episode OVA. Timeline: 2092.  
Produced by Big West, but made *without* the input of Studio Nue or Shouji Kawamori, who disavowed it for quite a while. However, little nods to it would appear in the other sequel series. It tells the story of a new alien invasion 80 years after the events of SDFM. These invaders are also motivated by song—and absolutist fanaticism.  
In more recent years, this OVA has gradually been accepted back into the official fold, first referred to as an alternate continuity, but more recently simply included in official series timelines even if its events no longer correspond with the other storylines. The franchise's meta framework allows it to exist as [another in-universe movie](https://twitter.com/GwynCampbell/status/1315132491770994688), after all.

###Madoka Magica

[Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756) -> [Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11981)

[Movie 1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11977) and [Movie 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11979) are recaps of the TV anime with a few scenes changed and improved on. They're worth watching if you're a fan of the anime, but I would recommend you *watch the anime first* and THEN watch the movies if you liked it. In my opinion, certain scenes in the anime have more impact if you're watching episodically.

###Magi  

[Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14513) -> [Magi: The Kingdom of Magic](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18115) -> [Magi: Sinbad no Bouken (TV)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31741)

There is also another alternative [watch order](/1w8ggp) that combines the strengths of both the chronological and broadcast orders.  

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on a [Light Novel Series](http://myanimelist.net/manga/3083/), and if you would like more depth to the story, it is recommended you read the light novels (after the anime.) There is also a [manga adaptation](http://myanimelist.net/manga/1345/), [a parody OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5118) (5 min per episode), and a [spin off manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/13544/) that focuses on Nagato Yuki.

Suggested Order: 

* [Mobile Police Patlabor: Early Days OVA series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1288) -> [Mobile Police Patlabor 1: The Movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1095) -> [Mobile Police Patlabor 2: The Movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1096)  
* [Patlabor WXIII: The Movie 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1290) - Comes chronologically between the two movies however was made after, and is a fairly self-contained movie that is subpar comparatively.

Alternate universe/storyline with the same characters:

* Mobile Police Patlabor -> The New Files OVAs

###-Monogatari / Bakemonogatari  

For the sake of convenience, this watch order guide will only be covering the most common watch orders for Monogatari. There are numerous more outside of the ones mentioned here, but for the sake of making this as easy to follow and straightforward as possible, they won’t be discussed here.
 

####Airing Order

[This visual guide](https://imgur.com/XD9rxlu) is good if you're more fond of infographics. 
 
[Bakemonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5081) -> [Nisemonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11597) -> [Nekomonogatari: Kuro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15689) -> [Monogatari Series: Second Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17074) -> [Hanamonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21855) -> [Tsukimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28025) -> [Owarimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31181) -> [Kizumonogatari I: Tekketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9260) -> [Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31757) -> [Kizumonogatari III: Reiketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31758) -> [Koyomimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32268) ->  [Owarimonogatari Second Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35247) ->  [Zoku Owarimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36999)
 
This order, as the name implies, more closely follows the original airing order of Monogatari’s anime adaptation. This one is generally recommended because it deepens the mystery surrounding some of the main characters and the world, though some argue it’s not true to the author’s intention because several of the adaptations were pushed back because of delays and technical issues.
 
####Novel Release Order
 
[Infographic](https://imgur.com/gallery/tX63UZg) by u/BlakexEkalb helping explain the order. 
 
[Bakemonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5081) -> [Kizumonogatari I: Tekketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9260) -> [Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31757) -> [Kizumonogatari III: Reiketsu-hen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31758) -> [Nisemonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11597) -> [Nekomonogatari: Kuro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15689) -> [Monogatari Series: Second Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17074) (1-11) -> [Hanamonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21855) -> [Monogatari Series: Second Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17074) (12-26) -> [Tsukimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28025) -> [Koyomimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32268) -> [Owarimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31181) -> [Owarimonogatari Second Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35247) ->  [Zoku Owarimonogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36999)  
 
This order is truthful to the source material’s release order, and dispels the extended mystery that happened in the original airing order, but offsets that by better grounding several characters’ relationships and clarifies some plot points. Some would argue this is the intended watch order as it best fits the author’s intentions.  
 
####Chronological Order
 
**WARNING: This watch order is not intended for first time viewings.** Watching it play out achronologically is a crucial component of the first time through, and this is only suggested for rewatchers.
 
Due to how complicated this order is (several arcs are concurrent and there’s a lot of series skipping), [this infographic](https://imgur.com/gallery/iXUyxam) shows the order needed to experience Monogatari chronologically. Watching Monogatari in this order brings different aspects of the story to light and a different perspective, and allows you to follow the progression in realtime.

####Bonus Order

###Mushishi

Mushishi is episodic, although it's recommended not to skip anything, or watch the series out of order. All episodes are standalone for the most part, but a lot of them can be confusing if you skip something because they require some background information from previous episodes.
 
You should watch them in airing order:
 
[Mushishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457) -> [Mushishi: Special: Hihamukage](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21329) -> [Mushishi Zoku Shou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21939) -> [Mushishi Zoku Shou Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687) -> [Mushishi Zoku Shou 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24701) -> [Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28957)

###Naruto / Boruto

Boruto is intended to be the entry point for a whole new generation of fans, as such it is not necessary to watch the original before picking it up. However, many things will be more satisfying if you've seen the original series and shippuden.
**Main story:**

[Naruto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20) -> [Naruto Shippuden](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1735)

[Naruto: The Last](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16870) should *only* be watched after finishing Shippuden.

The OVAs and Movies are generally unrelated to the main story so the time when you watch them is relatively unimportant. However a general guide is as follows (these are based on when the movie/ova was released in relation to the episodes that had been released at the time):

###Neon Genesis Evangelion / NGE

[Neon Genesis Evangelion TV Series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30) -> [The End of Evangelion (movie)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32) - expands on the ending of the tv series. MUST WATCH.  -> Rebuild Movies [1.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2759), [2.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3784), [3.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3785), and  [4.0](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786)   

It is important to note that episodes 21-24 of the TV series have a director's cut version which should be watched instead of the standard 21-24 to better understand the overarching plot. These episodes are 26-28 minutes long compared to the normal 23 minutes.  

The movie [Death and Rebirth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31) is a recap of the original series (Death), combined with the first half of End of Evangelion (Rebirth). "Death(true)²" is a later re-edit of the movie, containing only the recap portion with a few extra scenes.  

The Rebuild movies are rebuilds of the franchise. They *need* to be watched after the original tv series and End of Evangelion, though. Watching them first is not advised as it makes you lose a lot of context behind the characters and you won't fully appreciate the movies.

[No Game No Life](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19815) --> [No Game No Life: Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33674)

Zero is technically a prequel, but the story is framed as a conversation between two characters after the TV season, meaning that it has spoilers for the main series.

* Each seasons have 1 OVA, season 2 (Repeat) have a Movie, personally I recommend to watch S1 OVA before S2 Movie since they're directly connected.

[Noragami](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20507) -> [Noragami Aragoto](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30503)

**First season's OVAs:**

Please note that the two [Noragami OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20767) episodes should be watched after Noragami ***Aragoto*** episode 6 (before watching episode 7).

The second OVA should be watched *before* the first OVA. (Adapting chapters 24 and 25 respectively)

(Note it's not really that important when you watch that first OVA, but the second does contain spoilers.)

**Second Season's OVAs:**

The first [Noragami Aragoto OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30885) can be watched any time after Noragami episode 6. The second Aragoto OVA should not be watched before episode 9 of Aragoto - best to watch it after completion of the whole season.

###Pokémon

[Click here for a wiki page with in-depth information about how to get started on the Pokémon series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq/pokemon) *Written by /u/aniMayor.*

The main Pokémon television anime which began in 1997 is one long single continuity, but this can be divided into several "series", listed in the table below. The start of each series acts as a "soft reset" - a comfortable starting point for new audiences where new main characters will be introduced, core concepts will be re-explained, and so on (these also tie-in to major staff changes, changes in character design and art style, etc). Later series *do* make many callbacks, references, and character cameos from prior series, but these will always be recapped by either the narrator or the characters themselves.

---

###Precure

[Click here for a wiki page with in-depth information about how to get started on the Precure series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq/precure) *Written by /u/lilyvess.*

Precure exists on the same formula as Super Sentai, Kamen Rider or Power Rangers; each series in the franchise lasts for a year and is completely self contained from any other series in the franchise. Every series in the franchise can be seen with no prior knowledge, even the two sequel series are very accessible. Toei has kept all references and connections between series completely isolated in the crossover movies.

So the answer to the question “Where do I start?” has no wrong answer. Any point is a valid starting point. You can start from the beginning, pick the best, or a lot of people suggest just picking the series with the designs that most appeal to you. Note that all movies are optional and can be skipped.

###Psycho Pass

[Psycho Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601) -> [Psycho Pass 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281) -> [Psycho Pass Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21339) -> [Psycho Pass SS Case 1](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37440) -> [Psycho Pass SS Case 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37441) -> [Psycho Pass SS Case 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37442) -> [Psycho Pass 3](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39491)  

There is also a newer version of Psycho Pass, a re-cut 2014 version, which has 11 1-hour episodes instead of 22 24-min episodes.

The new edit version of Psycho Pass has:

* Reanimated Opening and Ending themes
* Additional minor scenes. These tend to be placed midway during the episodes to allow for a better transition between the two old episodes.
* Redone animation of particular scenes (and some additional CGI in places)
* Some music changes in scenes

The general consensus seems to be that the re-cut version has less impact and the pacing is a bit off, and that if you've seen the original 22 episode version, you do *not* need to watch the re-cut version.

5. [Vanquished Queens](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16363) (with [optional specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18231). It's not based on any existing source material, but this is probably the best place to put it.
5. [Queen's Blade OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10924) (with [optional specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12065)
6. [Queen's Blade: Rebellion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11859) (with [optional specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13855)

with [Queen's Blade: Grimoire](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30679) watchable at any point.

###Raildex / Toaru / Railgun / Index

There are two major camps for the show's watch order; Index first/broadcast order and Railgun first. Both orders have their own merits. The orders and their main arguments are stated below.

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/Nxh5co6.png) a simple infographic if you want to pick a side and ignore the rest. - Courtesy /u/RoyalAlchemistYT 

When you're inevitably confused by Railgun T episode 20 read over /u/razorhead's _small facts_ comments for the episode [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/idzmhq/toaru_kagaku_no_railgun_t_episode_20_discussion/g2e4o64/).

Please note, regardless of when you watch Index III, it is highly recommended to read /u/razorhead's _small facts_ for each episode in order to help keep up with the story pace. Can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/toarumajutsunoindex/wiki/smallfacts#wiki_index_iii)

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

####Railgun first

Railgun follows the story of Misaka, from her perspective and stays focused on the scientific side of the series. By sticking to only one side of the Science/Magic lore watching Railgun first makes the whole thing far easier to understand, while watching Railgun, but also while watching Index, which some viewers find convoluted and confusing. Having the scientific side of the story already explained allows you to focus more on the explanations of the magic side. 

Additionally, the main arc of Railgun S, which is widely considered the best arc of the animated, is only a minor arc in Index (15 episodes of S to 5 of Index). This arc is *extremely* emotional and suspenseful, factors which are heavily amplified if you're following the story while only knowing what Misaka (the PoV character) knows - an option which is completely lost once you've seen Index. Some viewers find that this suspense and emotional impact is heavily diminished when they you go into the arc having already seen the short version in Index. If you only know what Misaka knows, everything else becomes a mystery and you get to follow along as Misaka uncovers the details herself. This also has the effect of adding an additional air of mystery to Touma's character.

Some will complain about the overabundance of filler in the Railgun anime, however, if you haven't read the source material this won't affect you at all.

Suggested viewing orders for this are as follows:  

**Simplified 'chronological' order:**

*This order is optimal as far as amplifying the mystery of the show*

Railgun -> Railgun S  -> Index -> Accelerator -> Index II -> Endymion Movie -> Index III 1-6 -> Railgun T -> Index III 7+

Please note that if you so choose you very much can just watch all of Railgun and then all of Index, the only major point of issue will be Railgun T episode 20; in which case read the following _smallfacts_ by /u/razorhead after the relevant episode [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/idzmhq/toaru_kagaku_no_railgun_t_episode_20_discussion/g2e4o64/) for some more context

In this case the order would be: Railgun -> S -> T -> Index -> Accelerator -> Index II -> Endymion Movie -> Index III

**Optimal Chronological Order:**

*Less hassle than the full chronological order - additional relevant information on the world and some of the characters. Some concessions made in the last half of the order in order to make some things a bit less confusing*

[Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213) > [Index](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654) 1-9 > [Railgun S](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049) > Index 10+ > [Accelerator](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38480/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Accelerator) -> [Index II](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8937) 1-7 -> [Endymion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11743) -> Index II 8+ -> [Index III](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36432) 1-6 -> [Railgun T](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38481/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_T) -> Index III 7+ 

**Full chronological order:**

*The above watch orders are more than sufficient for maximum enjoyment. This order is here for those interested in when everything occurs. Mostly highlights what events are going on at the same time.*

See /u/Aniosophy's infographic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/toarumajutsunoindex/comments/gl88vy/new_20_version_railgunindex_infographic_with_full/) or direct link [here](https://i.redd.it/5sz5his1t8z41.jpg)

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

####Index first

The Index first order, or broadcast order, comes from the fact that Index is the parent story and Railgun is the spin-off designed to expand upon concepts, characters, and events introduced in Index. In fact, Railgun does not even touch on half of the series' universe, and the conflict between the two halves of the series' universe is a large part of the series' setting. But, because Index and Railgun share a major arc, it really comes down to what you want out of the series. Do you like fully cohesive lore, storylines, and character development? If so, then this order is the way to go. Do you value emotional impact? If so, then you should watch Railgun and Railgun S before Index episode 10 and on.

For some people not much of the emotional impact will be lost when watching Index first. J.C Staff did an amazing job of making the Railgun adaptation of the arc in question incredibly emotional, even when you know the outcome from the Index telling. If you're more interested in understanding the intricacies of the plot, character actions/development, and lore the first time around the Index order may be better suited for you.

Watch order:

Index -> Railgun -> Index II -> Railgun S -> Endymion ->  Index III -> Accelerator -> Railgun T

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**List of filler**

*It's important to note that while these episodes are technically filler, some of the filler arcs have characters which show up elsewhere in the Raildex universe and particular characters introduced in the filler are important later in the show proper.*

 - 13 to 24 of Railgun

 - 17-24 of Railgun S.


**Read order**

Notes:  

* Episode 1 was aired as a two part special; Episode 1a and 1b. These may be listed seperately or together depending on where you watch, but they only count as one episode in this list.
* Memory Snow is an OVA Special film that occurs between Arc 2 and Arc 3. It can be watched at the end of the first season as well.
* Frozen Bonds is a prequel OVA Special film that occurs before the first season. The source material spoils moments in the first season and heavily foreshadows moments in the second season, so it should be watched after the first season.  

Credit to /u/Theleux for this writeup

The directors cut is a slightly better looking re-cut of the first season and they put the OVA in its proper order. Watch that, especially if you’re gonna binge it.

>An edited version of the series received a rebroadcast starting January 1, 2020. Twenty-five episodes of the original series were combined into thirteen 49-minute long episodes with some scenes being slightly extended. The last four minutes of episode 13 featured new content, including a revelation about a character. The four-minute new content was included in at the beginning of the second season.

Trust and Betrayal happens late into the story and is a flashback to Kenshin before the series starts. If you have no intention of watching/reading the series proper it can be watched standalone with a couple cameos you won't understand. It is highly recommend to watch/read the series properly to get the full effect of the OVA. It is considered a classic and one of the most critically acclaimed OVA's ever made.

###Saint Seiya

Start on the **[classic TV](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1254)** series. It covers almost everything:

* A collection of small arcs
* Sanctuary arc (starts in EP41)
* Asgard Arc (starts in EP74. Anime-original, but really good!)
* Poseidon Arc (starts in EP100)

From there, you can either watch the old movies, there are 4 or 5 of them. All optional but I recommend watching at least the **[Abel movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1255)**. And then you wrap up with the **Hades** saga that concludes the story. It was released as OVAs.

* Hades Arc  (3 parts: [Sanctuary](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1257) -> [Inferno](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1253) -> [Elysion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3515)


After Hades, there's the Heaven Saga (Tenkai-hen), but I think it was anime original project and it has only one movie called **[Overture](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1259)** with a few cool fights an inconclusive end. It's a mess because this movie was released before the Inferno OVAs were complete and spoiled some stuff.

The TV anime, **[Soul of Gold](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28215)** takes place in parallel with Elysion and it's really good.

And then if you want you can watch **[Omega](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12929)**, which takes place after Hades and Heaven.

[Space Battleship Yamato](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1650) (1974) -> [Space Battleship Yamato II](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1651/) (1978) -> [Yamato: The New Voyage](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3071/) (1979)(Movie) [Be Forever Yamato](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3069/) (1980)(Movie) -> [Space Battleship Yamato III](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1652/) (1980) -> [Final Yamato](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3072/) (1983)(Movie) -> [Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7144/) (2009)(Movie)
 
You don't *need* to watch Resurrection, as it was meant to be *part 1* of a new film series, but as the 2010 live action was more popular than Resurrection, they decided to reboot the original instead.
There is a movie version of Yamato 74, but it’s just a retelling, with a few different parts, nothing special.
 
Yamato was originally brought to the US in the late 70s, as “Star Blazers”, as was the style of dubbing at the time, names were changed, but in this case the plot was kept the same. The crew of the Argoveleon had but one year to reach Iscandar and save Mother Earth, or she would be doomed. This however does **not** adapt the movies and only adapts the first three seasons. I’m not certain if it’s easy to find streaming subbed *or* dubbed.
 
 
Yamato Reboot
 
[Space Battleship Yamato 2199](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12029/) (2012) (Series / Movies): This is a reboot of the original, and can be watched standalone. It changes *some* events of the original Yamato, but it is a good substitute overall. 
 
[Space Battleship Yamato 2202](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33064/) (2017) (Series / Movies), this is a sequel to 2199, which adapts the events of season 2. As 2199 did, this changes some events, some characters, but stays overall fairly faithful to the original.
 
[Space Battleship Yamato 2199: Odyssey of the Celestial Ark](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23931/) (2014)(Movie) - This is set during the final episodes of 2199, it follows two characters we don’t see much of during the series, but it’s also skippable if you so choose. 
 
[Space Battleship Yamato 2205](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40389/) (2021) (Series / Movie), this will follow the events of New Voyage, so it should be shorter in length.

Note: These are available in either series (26 episodes) or film length (7 films). 
 
Spinoffs / Non-Canon 

[Arrivederci Yamato](https://myanimelist.net/anime/711/) (1977) (Movie): This is considered **NON-CANON**, due to the ending. This film was originally meant to *end* the series, but due to strong sales, was later retconned, with animation being re-used [for II](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3067/). 
 
[Yamato 2520](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6718/) (1994-1996)(OVA) This was an attempt to revive Yamato in the early 90s, but due to legal issues only 3 episodes were ever produced. 
 
Space Battleship Yamato Live Action (2010)(Movie) This takes the basic plot of the original and does something different essentially. Good visuals.

###Slayers

**Main Story**

[Slayers](https://myanimelist.net/anime/534) -> [Slayers Next](https://myanimelist.net/anime/535) -> [Slayers Try](https://myanimelist.net/anime/535) -> [Slayers Revolution](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4028) -> [Slayers Evolution-R](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5233)

**Prequels**

[Slayers Excellent](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1171) -> [Slayers: The Book of Spells](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1170) -> [Slayers: The Motion Picture](https://myanimelist.net/anime/536) -> [Slayers Return](https://myanimelist.net/anime/869) -> [Slayers Great](https://myanimelist.net/anime/868) -> [Slayers Gorgeous](https://myanimelist.net/anime/867)

**Side Story**

[Slayers Premium](https://myanimelist.net/anime/866)

**Notes**

- The Prequels can be watched anytime before or after any entry in the Main Story. They simply focus on the adventures of Lina and Naga and it is unnecessary to have seen the Prequels in order to understand the Main Story.

- [Slayers Premium](https://myanimelist.net/anime/866) should be watched after the second entry of the main story, [Slayers Next](https://myanimelist.net/anime/535).

[So Ra No Wo To](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6802) -> [So Ra No Wo To Specials](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8197)

The first special also serves as episode 7.5 chronologically and is preferably watched after episode 7. The second special should be watched after finishing the show.

###Soukyuu no Fafner

1. [Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor](https://myanimelist.net/anime/75)
2. [Soukyuu no Fafner: Right of Left](https://myanimelist.net/anime/560)
3. [Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Heaven and Earth](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8098)
4. [Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Exodus](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17080)

There are three translated drama CDs which take place during Dead Aggressor.

Stand By Me is the first which takes place in between episodes 2 and 3. The two really important ones that flesh out the characters and story though are NO WHERE which takes place during episode 11 but should be read/listened to afterwards and NOW HERE which occurs after the events of episode 18.

###Steins;Gate

[Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) -> [Steins;Gate 23B](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32188) -> [Steins;Gate 0](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30484)  -> [Steins;Gate 0: Kesshou Takei no Valentine - Bittersweet Intermedio](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37492) -> [OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10863) -> [Movie](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11577) (23B, 0, and Kesshou Takei no Valentine - Bittersweet Intermedio can also go after the OVA and Movie for release order)

Alternatively, 23B, Steins;Gate 0, and Kesshou Takei no Valentine - Bittersweet Intermedio can be watched in between Steins;Gate as follows:  

Steins;Gate Episodes 1-22 -> Steins;Gate 23B -> Steins;Gate 0 -> Steins;Gate 0: Kesshou Takei no Valentine - Bittersweet Intermedio -> Steins;Gate Episodes 23-24 -> OVA -> Movie

###Tokyo Ghoul  

If you're interested in only watching the animated entries without reading the manga, the order is the following:

[Tokyo Ghoul](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319) -> [Tokyo Ghoul Root A](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27899) -> [Tokyo Ghoul: "Jack" (OVA)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30458) -> [Tokyo Ghoul: "Pinto" (OVA)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31297) -> [Tokyo Ghoul:re](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36511) -> [Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37799)  

Do note that in Tokyo Ghoul Root A, the anime goes on its own route separate from the manga. Both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul:re are also rushed adaptations and aren't received very well. 

Therefore, the recommended order for Tokyo Ghoul is:

[Tokyo Ghoul (S1)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319) -> [Tokyo Ghoul (Manga)](https://myanimelist.net/manga/33327) -> [Tokyo Ghoul: "Jack" (OVA)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30458) -> [Tokyo Ghoul: "Pinto" (OVA)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31297) -> [Tokyo Ghoul:re (Manga)](https://myanimelist.net/manga/81117)

###Wake Up, Girls!

[Wake Up, Girls! Shichinin no Idol]( https://myanimelist.net/anime/21189/) -> [Wake Up, Girls!]( https://myanimelist.net/anime/19023/) -> [Wake Up, Girls! Seishun no Kage]( https://myanimelist.net/anime/28841/) -> [Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30419)

Important Notes:

- [Wake Up, Girls! no Miyagi PR Yarasete Kudasai!]( https://myanimelist.net/anime/32382/) is listed as a sequel to the final movie [Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30419). The conclusion of the movies is sufficient enough as the true ending of the Wake Up, Girls! series so aren't missing anything story related if you decide to skip the special.


- [Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34522) is also listed as a sequel to the final movie [Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30419). As of the date of this write-up (27/01/2017), there has been limited information on the series. Looking at the characters, it is likely that it could be a sequel to the final movie but could also very well be a reboot if they decide to cast different VAs in the main character roles.

###Wolfs Rain

[Wolf's Rain](https://myanimelist.net/anime/202) -> [Wolf's Rain OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1023)

Due to production issues, episode numbers 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the series are recap episodes told from the perspectives of other characters reusing dialog and footage from the start of the series. They can be skipped with no meaning on the story, only the very start of episode 18 has new footage of minor importance. The four OVA episodes are episodes that could not be aired due to the production issues but should be considered episodes 27-30 as they complete the story.

Interested in reading the manga? **Season 3** ends at Chapter 189, start reading from chapter 190. Keep in mind though that the Goddess Arc anime adaptation cut out a lot of important content so you will most likely be lost if you decide to pick up the manga right after. **Season 2** ends at chapter 41, start reading from chapter 42.

###Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru

Otherwise abbreviated to **Yu**uki **Yu**una wa **Yu**usha de Aru (**YuYuYu**)

**Release Date:**

[Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25519) -> Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou (WaSuYu) Movies: [Movie 1 - Tomodachi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34374) -> [Movie 2 - Tamashii](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34375) -> [Movie 3 - Yakusoku](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34376) -> [Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou Series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34284) -> [Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Sonogo no Sonoko](https://myanimelist.net/manga/86780/) (light novel) -> The Second Hero Diary (light novel) -> [Nogi Wakaba wa Yuusha de Aru](https://myanimelist.net/manga/90810/) (NoWaYu, light novel) - Chapters 1-11 -> [Shiratori Utano wa Yuusha de Aru](http://yuyuyu.wikia.com/wiki/) (light novel) -> [Nogi Wakaba wa Yuusha de Aru](https://myanimelist.net/manga/90810/) (NoWaYu, light novel) - Chapters 12-19 -> The Passed Baton (epilogue of NoWaYu) (light novel) -> [Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34445)



**Important Notes**

- For the best viewing experience, it is **highly recommended** that you watch the series in its release order, which is the order mentioned above.

- The **Washio Sumi no Shou movies and series** both cover the same content and there should not be any differences between them in this regard. Hence it is **acceptable to watch either one** before moving onto the last entry (as of writing this).

- All of the entries tagged as **light novel** have yet to receive an anime adaptation (as of writing this). If you are invested in the YuYuYu universe, it is **highly recommended** that you give them a read since they do add canon worldbuilding for the universe and allows you to spend more time with the characters you already love.

**Chronological Order** 

[1.](/s "Shiratori Utano wa Yuusha de Aru") -> [2.](/s "Nogi Wakaba wa Yuusha de Aru") -> [3.](/s "The Passed Baton") -> [4.](/s "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou Series/Movies") -> [5.](/s "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru") -> [6.](/s "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Sonogo no Sonoko") -> [7.](/s "Second Hero Diary") -> [8.](/s "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou")

**Light Novels**

If you are interested in reading the light novels, please head on over to check out /r/YuYuYu's writeup and where to find them in their post, [Light Novel Reading Order.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YuYuYu/comments/3jjmbh/yuyuyu_franchise_resourceslight_novel_reading/)

You can also check this [infographic](https://i.imgur.com/DcR1fri.png) for a bit more information on the order to watch the series.

**Anime Only Watch Order**

 If you're interested in only watching the animated entries, you can still understand and enjoy it fine enough without the light novels/manga. The release order is still the most recommended viewing, which is the following:

[Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25519) -> Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou, either the [Film Trio](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34374) or [Televesion Series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34284) -> [Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34445). 

Other animated entries are simply extras or recaps, and not necessary for viewing.
