**[OC] (original content) is defined, for the purposes of this subreddit, as the following:**

Original Content is a creation inspired from your own imagination and creativity. This can take inspiration from other artists or even official art, but the way the work is composed is distinctly your own without the intention of "copying".

**To add further clarity, we have included some examples below regarding what is "Original Content":**

* Example 1 - Edited pictures that fundamentally look like the original screenshot reference (Fanart but not OC), i.e. [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/D56N0um.jpg) and [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/Is6xE6Z.jpg). These are examples of art that have been edited and altered, but are close enough to the [original shot](https://i.imgur.com/mEha1v0.png) to be 'fanart' but not 'OC'. This would include similar wallpaper edits, for example collage and vector work.

* Example 2 - Pictures that draw heavy inspiration from an original screenshot but are different enough from the original to be considered OC (qualified OC), i.e. [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/yTwUkD4.jpg) compared to the [original screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GJ1UuXx.png). It is easy to notice the same reference in poses, but there is a distinctly different background and artstyle to make it look more like a referenced piece than a trace. This is OC.

* Example 3 - Pictures that are very high effort that reference a screenshot, but do not look like a 1:1 match (qualified OC, i.e. [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/DpszEA9.jpg) compared to the [original screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gAnaX1M.png). It is a completely different picture, is of a different art-style, and has high level of user-generated differences between the two, illustrating a referenced image completely re-imagined to truly seem original.

Hopefully, these visuals provide a clear enough deliberation between "Fanart" and "Original Content" work.

**So what does this mean on a global scale?**

1. It promotes actual "artists" to use their imagination. Everyone knows it takes more talent to do so and it deserves that "special" status. The current definition currently aggregates them with more casual sketches that heavily reference a screenshot or fanart.
 
2. Removing the kinds of submissions (as outlined and described above) from Original Content means that they are still considered Fanart. We definitely still think they have a place in the community, especially for more casual artists and fans. This means these still have to go through the text-post submission and album rules, which also encourages these submitters to reference and credit their images.
