* **Cour** - A cour refers to the length of the show. One cour is generally 3 months long, aka 11-13 episodes. If a show is two cours, it's 20-25 episodes long (6 months), three cours = 40-ish episodes (9 months), four cours = 50-ish episodes.

A cour is **not** a season. Anime 'seasons' are when there is a break in production. Attack on Titan is 2-cours, but *one season*, because there was no break in-between. Sometimes you get a 'split-cour' which is two cours, with 3 months break between each cour. These are often counted as different seasons. 

* **Season** - Season refers to two things.

1 -> The term used above, aka different seasons of anime, determined by there being a break in production between cours.

2 -> Seasons of production. There's the Fall Season, Summer Season, Spring Season, and Winter Season. Each season is made up of certain months, in sets of three (aka one cour!). Each season begins near the beginning of its first month and ends near the end of its last month.

*Winter season* - January, Feburary, March/April

*Spring season* - April, May, June/July

*Summer Season* - July -> August -> September/October

*Fall Season* October>November>December/January

* **ONA** - Original Net Animation. Anime released on the internet originally. They tend to be shorter than TV anime.

* **OVA** - Original video animation. Anime released on DVD and/or other home video formats. It may be a special bundled with the series, a stand alone short, or a full-length series. Often, run-times vary unlike the typical half-hour/hour blocks that TV anime use. 

* **TV Anime** - Anime released by being broadcasted on TV first. These are typically series where each episode lasts 22-24 minutes each.

* **Special** - often used synonymously with OVA, specials are usually extra episodes of already existing TV anime.

* **Movie** - anime released in theaters first.

* **BD** - Blu-ray Disc. Most anime are sold in blu-ray format (as well as DVD format).

####Demographic & Genre Related Terms

* **Seinen** - A series in which the source material manga was originally published in a magazine targeted towards older males. These series do not have anything directly in common other than this. A fair amount of series are from Seinen magazines.

Demographics are **NOT** genres. Never judge a series based on the demographic tag, because it does not correlate to the contents of the series. 

As an example, [*K-on!*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) is a **Seinen** show, and so is [*Black Lagoon*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon). K-on! is a show about cute girls and its genres are Slice of Life, Comedy, and Music. Black Lagoon is a show about mercenaries and its genre is 'Action' - notice how even though they are both **Seinen** they are nothing alike? This applies to ALL demographics.
