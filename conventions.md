# FAQ


## What is this “convention” thing?

In theory, an anime convention is a large gathering of fans who share a common interest. In practice, however, it manifests in about a million different ways. Every con has its own idea of what a con should be, so it’s very hard to define. In the Guide to Cons below, a few of the broad types of cons are covered, so give those a read and see what seems right for you. On the broad scale, conventions generally span across a weekend, and feature panels covering a wide variety of topics, guests relevant to the anime community (both Western and Japanese), and some assortment of vendors (merchandise and artistic).

## That sounds pretty lame, why do people go to those things?

Well, hey now, let’s not be so negative. Everyone has their own reasons for going, and considering that bigger cons can draw crowds in the tens of thousands, that’s a pretty diverse group you’re going to draw.  I would think that the predominant reason people attend is to have a good time with their friends, whether it’s just one or two other people or a group of fifteen. Conventions are an extremely social event, and a large majority of people come with friends (not that people don’t have fun alone). A number of people also go for cosplay, both to do it and to appreciate it. If you decide to cosplay at a con, expect to have your picture taken every few minutes (or for hours at a time, at the bigger cons). There are also people who come just for the vendor halls, but that’s more a thing at the big conventions. Overall, most people are just there to have fun. Now, the definition of “fun” can really vary from person to person, so odds are you’ll find a few (or most) of the people a bit annoying – just ignore them, it’s pretty much guaranteed you’ll find more people just like you at the con.

## So, what exactly do you do at these cons?

Unsurprisingly, this is also going to vary from person to person. Cons provide a good number of things to do, and you’re conveniently given a schedule when the con starts. The schedule mostly consists of panels, both run by fans and industry guests. The idea behind a convention panel is that a few presenters talk about a topic for a while, usually because they have something interesting to add to the conversation, and then open it up to questions and conversation with the audience. Panel attendance can range from 20 to 2000, and presenters vary from just average fans to experts with decades of relevant experience. Guests of cons also usually have their own panels, autograph sessions, and sometimes even concerts. Check the con webpage for more info on that kind of stuff. Some of the most fun at conventions can be had just walking around, seeing what’s going on around the venue, and talking to other fans. There are also video showings, art shows, costume contests, skit competitions, and about a million other things – they’re usually well described in the con book you get with your registration. Most big cons also have a dance (often called a “rave”), but that deserves its own section.


## Well, how much do they cost?

Pretty much every con has a registration fee, the price of which mostly depends on the size of the con. For most conventions, you’re also most likely going to be looking at booking a hotel for the weekend, which can get pretty expensive in most cities. Generally conventions reserve a “con block” – a set of rooms at a reduced rate that are only available to congoers. You’ll want to reserve early though, rooms fill up fast. It’s very common to see people splitting rooms, sometimes to an extreme. It’s a good idea to keep things simple your first few times,  but if you want to try and fit 12 people into a two bed room, more power to you. If you live close to the con, it may be tempting to try and commute in, but if it’s more than a 15 minute drive, you may want to consider a hotel anyway. Parking near conventions can be a nightmare, and at the bigger cons, there are things to do up until three or four in the morning – maybe not the best time to drive when you’re not getting a lot of sleep all weekend. There are a few costs people tend to forget, including parking for the weekend, food (please eat!), and merchandise! If you’re immune to the allure of the dealers hall that’s fantastic, but it’s difficult for most people to leave there without buying at least a thing or two.

## Which con should I go to?

For starters, try going to one near where you live. Having your first con be one that you have to travel 500 miles to attend introduces a lot more complication, and can be extremely overwhelming. Most areas have at least a small convention, and if you live near a city, generally it’ll have its own con. After that, if you decide that you like them, go to what you can! If you have friends going to cons all over the country, it can be a great way to spend a weekend in a faraway city. If all you want to attend is your local con, you can quickly find it becoming a tradition between yourself and friends, or even just for yourself.

## Big Cons vs Small Cons

There are a ton of cons all around the world, and while some may draw a few hundred people, others get tens of thousands who attend. Smaller cons feel more like they're focused on meeting people, and discussing anime and such. A lot of the time, people are going to be very willing to have a conversation, play video/board games, things like that. Not that it doesn't happen at bigger cons, but what I've noticed with bigger cons is that people come with a very large group of friends, which is harder to draw people away from to meet and such. 

Larger cons focus a lot more on the content, like panels and vendors, and the cosplay. Big cons are a lot of fun if you go with friends, but I've found that going alone makes you feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. They generally draw more well-known guests, and can usually get one or two musical guests who do a big concert. I definitely wouldn't worry about small cons being unknown or anything, though. You'll find good and bad people at any con, it's mostly just a matter of finding what works well for you. 

## Industry Cons vs Fan Cons
Alt. title: Anime Expo vs. Every Other Convention

So, this is a bit of a contentious topic. Anime Expo (probably the most prolific anime industry convention) is sort of like the San Francisco Comic Con of anime conventions – it’s huge, takes large amounts of money from industry partners, and its schedule is heavily influenced by what those partners desire. Not to say that it’s a bad thing, but this has a significant effect on the feel of the con. It’s going to have a lot of huge panels focused on new releases by the big licensing companies, leaving a bit less room in the scheduling for fan-run panel content. Guests of the convention are also heavily influenced by corporate partners, though that can sometimes be very beneficial. Industry conventions draw a lot of amazing, professional cosplay – mostly as a factor of their size. If cosplay is a convention interest of yours, a con like Anime Expo would be right up your alley.

Fan conventions are usually run by fans, contain primarily fan-run or fan-generated content, and don’t take (a lot of) funding from big corporate partners. There are also very large fan cons, but the majority are small, local conventions. Fan-panels can vary widely in content and quality, though the content is often unique and relatable to fans with similar interests. Deciding between the two types is really just a matter of what you’re looking for in a convention. I’d of course recommend trying both and seeing how you like them, but for a lot of people, that can be quite a long trip just to see a different type of convention.

## The Con Dance

Alright people, let’s talk. This is an issue near and dear to my heart, so give this some thought. No convention has a “rave”, but a lot of them like to provide a similar atmosphere. If you are someone who likes to go to anime conventions just for the “rave”, you are a plague on anime conventions. I can say without a doubt that the rudest, most irritating, and most obnoxious congoers are those who spend all day in their “rave” outfits, ignore convention programming as you wait for the “rave”, then go to the dance and act like children. Not only that, but in some cases there are also drugs involved, which only increases the risk of danger to yourself and others. Conventions have dances to provide a safe, fun environment in which fans can enjoy some music, dancing, and the company of their friends. Acting like that can only serve to damage that environment, and perpetuate the attitude that conventions have a “rave” and that acting like obnoxious children is acceptable behavior.

That all being said, con dances can be a lot of fun. Here are a few tips if you want to attend:

•	Water. Your body needs it. In fact, it needs a lot of it. Drink water before, during, and after the dance, because the last thing you want to do is pass out in a crowd of sweaty people.

•	If someone is bothering you or your friends, try and move away. If it’s still happening, or if you see them bothering someone else, flag down a member of convention staff. They usually wear easily recognizable uniforms, and try to be very proactive about stopping that kind of behavior.

•	Try to go with friends, and watch out for your friends during the dance. It’s easy to get split up, but if that happens, don’t just assume that they’re safe – it’s not unheard of for dangerous situations to arise at con dances.

•	Have a good time! Usually the DJs are pretty alright, and the dancing isn’t bad either. You don’t have to feel obligated to go, there’s usually plenty of other stuff to do instead.

## Buying Things at Conventions

If you’re used to buying anime merchandise online, you’re going to be a bit surprised by convention dealers. In terms of figures, most feature pretty much only prize figures, marked up from the prices you’d see online. Even taking account that you’re not paying shipping, you may find that things are much more expensive than you could find from other sources. Dealers often try to target the inexperienced buyer, passing off cheaper figs as top merchandise. Most conventions are very strict about bootleg figures, but you should still be wary of deals that are too good to be true. Other merchandise, like gundam kits, t-shirts, and  wall scrolls, can usually be found at reasonable prices. Some major figure companies attend the bigger conventions, which is a great way to get new figures at just about retail price with no shipping. Manga and assorted anime DVDs are usually available in vast quantities, and usually you can get a good deal if you’re buying large amounts. Some specialty vendors exist for things like English-translated VNs, doujinshi, artbooks, and Japanese media, but they’re hard to find. Also, it may be worth holding off on some purchases until the last day of the convention, as some dealers put on special deals for the last day.
