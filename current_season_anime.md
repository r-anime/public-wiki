Times after 24:00 in JST are simply after midnight times by how many hours after 24 it is in Japan(i.e. 26:30 is 2:30am the next day). I keep them like this because it's still going to be the previous day for the rest of the world when it airs.  This is only for shows with licensed subs showing up several days after they air in Japan, all other shows are in EST for their licensed airing time.
