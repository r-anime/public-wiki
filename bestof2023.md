##BEST OF /R/ANIME 2023

The Best Of awards are divided into 12 categories. In each category, the top nominations will be given a Best Of /r/anime 2023 award.

This wiki page is to serve as an archive of the best <x> of the year, with it being added to as the year goes on so that things aren't forgotten about and the best of process runs more smoothly and more fairly than in previous years. The intent is not to filter what goes here (within reason), as actual selection of the best of the year will occur at the end of the year.
