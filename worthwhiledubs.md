Note: Since almost all modern dubs are good, instead of just listing all dubs released in the past 6 years and the ones getting released, the exceptional ones that stand out will be highlighted. 2013 is a mostly arbitrary year. If you have a better idea of a cutoff point for a "modern dub," let me know. If you have any suggestions on dubs to be added, please make a case for each one (good cast, writing, etc) instead of just sending me a list.

Since voice casts very rarely change with sequels, assume the dub for the sequel is also recommended. i.e If I recommend the dub for Code Geass R1, the dub for R2 is also recommended. Same goes for the above. The exception is of course when the cast changes for the sequel, like JoJo.

These recommendations are specifically for the *dub.* The quality of the show overall, as well as the Japanese voice acting, is irrelevant.

Finally, these are all english dubs. If there are any dubs in your language that you feel belong, let me know.
