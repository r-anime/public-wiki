# Frequently Asked Questions
These are questions we often get or have to deal with on a regular basis. If you're linked to this page, don't consider it a "brushing-off"; we simply want to have a standardized way of dealing with certain questions. 

#Posting-Related Issues

##My post was removed! Why are you targeting me? This post is clearly on-topic!

For the most part, when we get this question, it wasn't removed by a mod personally. Reddit has a built-in spam filter that uses certain heuristics to try to determine if a particular post is spam. The sad fact is, for the most part, it's about as accurate as a person playing darts using only a minigun in a spinny office chair. That is to say, not very. Known things that trigger the spam filter are:

* New accounts

* Posting the same link multiple times in short succession.

* Deleting and re-submitting the same post, especially multiple times in short succession.

Please note that rarely are posts actually removed by the moderators, and leading into a conversation with accusations of bias tends to start off a relationship on the wrong foot.

## How do I message the moderators?

The quickest and most effective way to get in touch with us in case of an issue is to use the Message the Moderators function on the /r/anime front page, or to put "/r/anime" in the "To" line of a PM. Messages to individual moderators will get answered, but making sure to message all the moderators through the "Modmail" function ensures that whoever's on first will see it and can deal with it. 

## What kind of things can I do to ensure my issues dealt with as quickly as possible?

What a handsome question. If your mail is in regard to a specific post, please include a link to the post in question. For link or text submissions, a link to the comments page is best. For a comment issue, please use the permalink to the comment in question.

## How do I make sure I'm not spoiling anything?

Use the [Spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_when_and_how_to_tag_spoilers), Luke!

## <Insert Name of Con Here> is coming up, can you add it to the sidebar?

To be added to the sidebar, all of the following must be true:

1. The convention must be primarily dedicated to anime.

2. The convention must have had at least 2,000 attendees the previous year.

3. There must be a Reddit Meetup thread in /r/anime about the convention. 

4. I'm order to be linked in the sidebar, the convention must be no more than 2 months away.

If all of those are true, send us a link to the meet-up thread and we'll post it in the sidebar.

# Other Reddit-related questions

## Why was my bot banned?

We have a policy of banning any bot from posting in /r/anime. This even applies to "helpful" bots that fix posts or find context for things. If you have a bot, we request that you add /r/anime to its ignore list. Attempts to evade this ban may result in your personal account being banned.

# Non-Reddit questions

## Where do I watch anime?

It depends on what you want to watch. Most libraries (especially those near major cities) will have piles of DVDs for you to peruse and borrow. If you're using the internet, [Hulu (US only)](http://www.hulu.com), [Funimation's Website](http://www.funimation.com/shows), [Netflix (Subscription required)](http://www.netflix.com), [CrunchyRoll](http://www.crunchyroll.com), [TubiTV](https://tubitv.com), [Amazon Prime](https://www.primevideo.com/), [VRV](https://vrv.co), and [HiDive](https://www.hidive.com/) are your best sources for legal anime. 

### Crunchyroll vs Funimation

**Funimation**: Funimation contains the largest English dub library and do Simuldubs with English when the dubs become available. Funimation also provides "Uncut" versions of certain shows. Note, Uncut does not mean Uncensored. Some of the shows, like Shinometa, are uncensored in English but are censored in Japanese. Funimation also has a "Restrict Mature Content" option which Crunchyroll does not provide as of right now, as well as having  a more modern UI.

**Crunchyroll**: Crunchyroll contains a MASSIVE amount of anime, much more than Funimation does and it even contains lesser known titles which may be a benefit to you. Crunchyroll's UI is not as pretty as Funimation however it just works.
Crunchyroll also only provides censored anime content, if this is something you are concerned about it is something that you should consider. Crunchyroll also provides some manga titles with their subscription if it is  something you are also interested in.

**The ideal**: The best thing to do, if you can afford it, is to get both Funimation and Crunchyroll. You will have access to the majority of current seasonal anime that are currently being broadcast. Another reason to consider having both, is that sometimes Funimation will have access to the English version while Crunchyroll will have access to the Japanese version. Two examples of this are A Certain Magical Index and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. Funimation has the rights to the English Dub and Crunchyroll has the rights to the Japanese Dub. Both have viable and user friendly apps.

The bottom line is that if English dubbed anime is what you want then you should go with Funimation. If content is what you want and you are okay with subtitles then Crunchyroll is the way to go.


## Where do I buy anime?

Oh, lots of places. Amazon and Right Stuf are generally considered the best. Sometimes you can find good things at places like Salvation Army, Goodwill, Savers, and other thrift shops. Best Buy has a really tiny anime section now, but sometimes you can find a good gem there. Places like FYE and Barnes and Noble tend to be rather overpriced, but may be your only option. 

## What should I watch?

This question varies a lot depending on what kind of shows you traditionally like, but generally our [Recommendations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations) will have the community's opinons on that.
