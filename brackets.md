##Introduction  

The /r/anime bracket contests take place on [animebracket](https://animebracket.com/brackets/past/) and are organized by members of the Reddit /r/anime community. The contests consist of a nominations period, eliminations period, and a voting period. During the voting period, entries are matched up against a single opponent according to their seeding and move on to the next round if they receive more votes.  

* Your Reddit account must be at least 2 months old to vote in the contests.

* Previous contest winners are not eligible for future contests.
