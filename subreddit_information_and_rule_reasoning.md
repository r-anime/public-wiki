### Post Flairs


All posts are required to be marked with a flair based on what kind of content they contain. We currently have the following flairs to choose from:


* **Discussion** [text only] — For posts focused on discussing anime in general.

* **Help** — For specific questions about anime, such as "Where is this character from?" or "What sources are there for this anime?" Please check our [FAAQ](/r/anime/wiki/faaq) before posting.

* **What to Watch** [text only] — For asking for recommendations about what anime to watch. You can also use the [Daily Anime Questions, Recommendations, and Discussion thread](/r/anime/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ADaily) to ask for recommendations.

* **News** — For posts concerning new announcements, new developments, or current events in the anime industry, Important PSAs about events such as breaches or hacks of widely-used anime sites.

* **Rewatch** — For community-run group rewatches of an anime. For more information, please see our [rewatches wiki](/r/anime/wiki/rewatches).

* **Official Media** — For new, non-informational, official publications such as key visuals, voice actor statements, etc. Official media should link to the official source or include the source in comments.

* **Clip** — For clips pulled directly from anime.

* **Video Edit** — For fan-edited anime footage.

* **Video** — For videos that don't fall under Clip/Video Edit (reviews, covers, analysis, etc.)

* **Watch This** [text only, at least 1500 characters] — Long-form writings which encourage readers to watch a certain anime by analyzing its strengths and weaknesses.

* **Writing** [text only, at least 1500 characters] — For general long-form writing about anime (reviews, analysis, etc.) not covered by the "Watch This" category.

* **Infographic** — For images containing useful information presented in a way that makes the information more informative, appealing, engaging, or easier to read.

* **Misc.** — For miscellaneous content which doesn't fit into any of the above categories.

Additionally, there are some special flairs which serve specific purposes that most users shouldn't use:

* **Contest** — For [AnimeBracket](https://animebracket.com/) contests such as, most famously, the annual Best Girl contests now run by /u/mpp00. 

* **Weekly** — For posts that occur once a week. These include Casual Discussion Fridays and the Weekly Roundup.

* **Writing Club** — For essays written as part of the /r/anime Writing Club. If you're interested in participating, check out the [Writing Club wiki](/r/anime/wiki/writing_archive).

* **Episode** — For episode discussion threads posted under the /u/AutoLovepon account. If a thread is late, [please send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/anime) instead of posting it yourself.

* **Satire** — For content which parodies anime or the anime industry. Automatically set when posting certain sites like [Animemaru](http://www.animemaru.com/).

* **Meme** — [Memes are not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_no_memes.2C_image_macros...) so posts with this flair will be removed automatically. This exists to filter memes from users that want to post before reading the rules.

* **Merch** — Merchandise posts are not allowed so posts with this flair will be removed automatically. Merchandise should be posted in our [Daily Anime](/r/anime/search?q=flair%3ADaily&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) or Casual Discussion Fridays threads. Collection posts and purchases, including gifted/received items, count as merchandise. You may also use this thread for Merchandise related questions.


If your post has not been flaired within 15 minutes, it will be removed. If this happens, please resubmit your post and add a flair within the 15 minute window.

**Note**: Many of these flairs have additional requirements associated with them. Read through the rest of the rules to ensure that your post meets any applicable requirements.

Prior to 2018-08-01, content categorization was done primarily through tags in the title of a post (e.g. starting your post's title with `[Fanart]`) before these flairs were introduced. Posts tagged in this way will automatically have the appropriate flair applied for the time being; however, this is not guaranteed to work forever.


Because we maintain a very general anime sub, it follows that not all of our users like seeing the same type of content. Flairing posts allows users who wish not to see certain types of content to filter them out using various tools such as the [RES browser extension](https://old.reddit.com/r/enhancement) or the built-in CSS-based filtering on desktop Reddit.

### The Spam Filter
The spam filter is a feature of Reddit. It automatically hides posts that it thinks are spam. All such posts are then lumped together into a list only we moderators can see.

#### How it works

The basic idea is that it checks some attributes of a given post or comment for things that make it look like spam. It likely considers all of the following and probably more:

* The poster's account's age
* The poster's link/comment karma for /r/anime
* The poster's total link/comment karma
* The website the post links to, if any

As moderators, we can mark something as spam or not as spam. What this does is train the spam filter to remove similar posts in the future. A good example of this is that most, if not all, bit.ly links are automatically marked as spam, be they in comments or posts due to our link shortening rule.

#### What To Do If Your Post Was Removed

[Send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fanime) with a link to the comment section of your post. It is completely acceptable to politely present an argument as to why it is not against the rules after we inform you what rule it broke, which can result in us reinstating the post. A general rule of thumb is to be polite. A fairly large percentage of posts are caught by the spam filter and aren't against the rules; don't assume we removed it.

However, if we did remove it, then it was because we think it broke the rules. That said, if we say we're not going to allow the post, please just accept it and move on. Arguing with us or insulting us once we've made it clear we will not approve it will not help you and has resulted in people being banned in the past.


## Rule Reasonings

### Anime-Specific Content 

Back in ye olde days, there were many posts on /r/anime about the general culture of anime and things anime fans might also like, such as other cartoons and video games. Given the ease of subscribing to multiple subreddits combined with the fact that we wanted /r/anime to focus on the discussion of anime, we added this rule and narrowed the focus from otaku culture to specifically anime.

We want to ensure that all discussion on /r/anime is strictly about what we consider "anime". We do not consider anime to be a style. That's too vague and blurs the line between anime and other kinds of animation. "anime" in Japanese may mean animation more widely, but we are speaking English, so there's no point using "anime" in the West unless you're talking about Japanese animation. Therefore, we narrowed our subreddit to this specific rule.

Occasionally, we make exceptions if you send us a modmail asking permission first. It is very rare that we allow a post that is against the rules when permission was not granted in advance.


### Hentai 

This isn't a porn subreddit, and it shouldn't be treated as one. Though anime can get racy at times, we have a hard limit to keep this subreddit accessible to as many people as possible. On the other hand, we also try to avoid restricting content that has a significant relevance to the discussion, such as episode screenshots.

Keep in mind that we will remove all suggestive or implied sexual content in order to maintain compliance with [Reddit-wide policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive).

### Spoiler 

Spoilers ruin the fun of watching and enjoying any sort of story or narrative experience. By being careful with your spoilers and tagging, this helps everyone in the community feel like they can discuss without fear of ruining potential enjoyment of other stories.

The reasoning for the blanket rule over all sources is partially because many anime are sourced from manga, VNs, and books. Going further, however, it makes sense to disallow spoilers from all mediums to keep it consistent and to not ruin anything for others. The vast majority of time the generality of this rule is a non-issue.

An easy example of a spoiler is knowing the twist of a movie prior to watching. By having knowledge of said twist, all the surprise and suspense will be lost because you already know what happens. Note that this is a very broad and obvious example, and we limit more than this.


### Clips and Videos 

Anime videos come in many styles and are an important part of the anime culture. The only restriction is that you cannot post more than 2 clips a month and 4 videos per week to prevent spam.

Clips of anime that work out of context are a great way to garner exposure towards shows. We restrict clips to a week after airing in order to focus the discussion of a certain episode in its discussion thread, and we also impose a maximum duration of 5 minutes to avoid uploads of the majority of an episode. In addition, we require all clips to follow some basic quality assurance guidelines, so as to both limit the amount of low effort clips posted, but also ensure they are enjoyable to watch.

### Fanart 

By nature of anime, many like to both create original works or share works that relate to shows they have watched. We realize that this is an integral part of the anime community, but it must also be balanced with other content that users want to see when coming to /r/anime. The rules help us give proper credits to the artists and prevent the abuse of "easy to consume content" that can flood the front page.

### Music Soundtrack Covers 

Uploading full soundtracks and songs typically skirts copyright, something that we would prefer to avoid. We also want to keep music relevant to an anime that is being discussed or is just being released.

### Illegal Content 

First off, you should have read the [Reddit user agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement). In the off chance you haven't, here are the applicable sections:

[Your Content](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/useragreement#wiki_your_content)

> You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, **and that your User Content does not violate the copyright, trademark**, trade secret or any other personal **or proprietary right of any other party.**

Which means submission of illegal/unlicensed content.

[Moderators:](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/useragreement#wiki_moderators)

> When you receive notice that there is content that **violates this user agreement** on subreddits you moderate, **you agree to remove it.**

It is our duty to remove said content violations.

If you are unfamiliar with copyright law, the United States and Japan have both signed the [Berne Convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works), which provides automatic reciprocal copyright. Simply put, all anime released in Japan is copyrighted in the United States, thus linking to non-official streams, downloads, etc is against reddit terms of service as well as US copyright law.

Finally, to those of you outside of the U.S., we realize that there are fewer official sources to watch anime, and that buying anime on DVD or BluRay is not always an option. We hope that you understand the position we've taken at /r/anime with respect to this issue, even if it may be inconvenient for you.

Proxy sites serve to circumvent licensing and usually aim to sidestep the intent of the distributors, and as such linking/leading people to them will not be permitted either.

### Episode and Movie Discussions 

By using a standard bot and format, it makes it easier for users to traverse old archives of discussion threads. [We also have a well organized archive run by very lovely /r/anime users!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/discussion_archive). Prior to limiting posts to the bot, users would rush to create threads without standard titles or contents in a rush for karma, often bogging down /new and forcing moderators to determine which thread would stay up. Using the bot guarantees that discussion isn't lost to duplicate threads doomed to deletion. Users have also deleted their accounts in the past, rendering the posts inaccessible.

Depending on the delay between the official Japanese release and the English release, we might do two separate threads or sticky the old one.

A small set of users can post in the bot account if it is not functioning correctly. We remove all other discussion threads that are not posted through this account.

### Meta Content 

This rule is a result of the first rule (everything posted here must be anime-specific). We realize that there needs to be a channel of communication for the sake of suggestions or complaints about how the subreddit is arranged or ran, and the monthly meta thread is a perfect way to keep things unobtrusive, while also guaranteeing that your complaints will be seen and discussed by the moderators and the rest of the community.

You can find the latest Meta Thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=subreddit%3Aanime+title%3A%22Meta+Thread%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=month)

### Memes 

This rule is meant to make posts like those found on /r/animemes, /r/anime_irl, /r/AdviceAnimals, etc against the rules. These posts are generally of low quality and rarely generate good discussion. Before they were against the rules, the comments in such threads tended to just be puns, memes, or worse. Our goals with these rules are to encourage more discussion and to prevent a slew of meme posts pushing discussion off the front page.

### Do Not Sell Things 

We don't want people to use /r/anime as a platform to make money. /r/anime is meant to be a place to enjoy and discuss anime, not a place to make money.

We ban referral scams as they are a manipulative way of making money by spreading a link. We don't want to encourage this behavior, especially since many of the websites that facilitate doing this are harmful.

### Infographic 

Infographics can be some of the best content people can produce, but they can also be prone to abuse and low effort edits. The idea with this section is to target specific sets of infographics that are very problematic while not banning everything else with them.

### Restricted and Low Effort Content 

We want to uphold a minimum standard of quality as a premier anime community, and keeping content at a certain level of quality goes a long way to meet this goal. 

We receive a lot of simple questions, image posts, and Google-able questions that can quickly clutter the subreddit. Currently, the only image posts that are allowed are relevant or highly informative (such as infographics and promotional materials for anime) in an effort to reduce this spam. However, keep in mind that /r/anime is not a rumor mill. We don't want to spread misinformation that sticks around for months, nor do we wish for clickbait rumors or fake leaks to take over the sub. Once something is proven to be true, we will allow it.

Many types of restricted or low effort content are not allowed because of their ability to take over the front page. /r/anime is primarily a discussion based subreddit - this type of content generally strays away from this idea, generating high amounts of karma with low amounts of actual discussion. 

### Link Shortening Services 

This rule exists to protect our users from malicious websites. It is possible to change where shortened links point. It is not immediately clear if the website linked is malicious. They can be used to avoid the spam filter. They also offer little benefit to anyone but the poster.
This includes websites such as bit.ly as well as ad-shorteners such as adf.ly Reddit offers a simple way to "mask" links with text.

For example, if the link you want to send people to is https://google.com
The syntax for using a masked link is: [name](https://www.google.com) which looks like: name

### Invasions and Raids 

We want discussion and post movements to be organic and not manipulated. Users shouldn't be able to buy or influence their way to more exposure outside of the content they create. /r/anime is not your personal army, nor is it a battleground to declare war on. This rule will be heavily enforced without exception. 

### Bots/Novelty Accounts 

We do not allow bots on /r/anime, even "useful" bots. Whenever we see a comment or post by one, that bot is banned. We would appreciate it if you blacklisted /r/anime in your bot's configuration to save us the hassle. Bots clutter comment sections and can spawn chains of memes about them.
