#Common Questions About Certain Series

###What episodes are filler in Naruto/One Piece/Bleach/Fairy Tail?

[Naruto (Shippuden),](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden) [Naruto,](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto) [Fairy Tail,](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/fairy-tail) [One Piece,](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece) and [Bleach.](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach)

###Is Katanagatari related to the Monogatari series?

Short answer: No. **Not at all.** 

Longer answer: No, not at all, *but* they do have the same author, **Nisio Isin**. The reason they have similar names is that he likes to create portmanteaus with all of his titles. 'Monogatari' means 'story', so Katanagatari means 'Sword Story', Bakemonogatari means 'Monster Story', Nisemonogatari means 'Fake Story', etc...!

##What Happened at the end of...

###Angel Beats: 
[Hopefully this should explain it for you.](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/279)


###Clannad: After Story: 

[This it the best explanation I could find,](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/258) however, it contains **SPOILERS for the Clannad Visual Novel** - if you don't mind them, go ahead and read it.


###End of Evangelion:

Want to know what happened in End of Evangelion? [Here ya go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1bi3a1/end_of_evangelion/c99qpcm) 
 
Interested in theories regarding Evangelion, the Rebuilds, etc? Go to /r/evangelion or check out [EvaGeek's Theories and Analyses page.](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Category:Theory_and_Analysis)

###FLCL:

The basic answer to this question is:

[FLCL Spoilers](/s "FLCL's main theme is coming-of-age. So basically, the whole series is full of metaphors for puberty and sexual awakening.")

###Haibane Renmei?

The only answer to this is 'No one *really* knows.' That is, no one knows the 'canon' answer. Haibane Renmei's meaning and interpretation is really up to each individual viewer to figure out. 

As such, there are a LOT of different thoughts about Haibane Renmei and I'd encourage you to read many articles and analyses about it. Hopefully this will help you to choose a theory you like best, or maybe you'll come up with your own theory. The story is completely open to interpretation after all.

One place to start would be reading Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami. The 'End of the World' part is said by Yoshitoshi ABe to have heavily inspired Haibane Renmei.

###Madoka Magica?

[Here is an explanation of Rebellions ending](http://the-artifice.com/madoka-magica-movie-3-rebellion-2013-ending/). If you're interested in reading more about The Rebellion Story I'd really recommend poring over the [Rebellion Story Wiki](http://wiki.puella-magi.net/The_Rebellion_Story), or the Madoka Magica Wiki in general, it's a very detailed Wiki.

###Mawaru Penguindrum...

Disclaimer: Most people don't.

[This article](http://mahoutofu.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/analysis-deconstructing-mawaru-penguindrum-part-i-let-us-share-the-fruit-of-fate/), along with the ridiculously handy chart it presents you (seriously, that chart makes everything make sense) is a good place to start. It describes the basic plot of Mawaru Penguindrum quite well. The second part, about the penguins, is also an interesting read - although [](/s "supposedly the penguins were only added in to make it more accessible to the average viewer. AKA they're comic relief.")

However, I would greatly encourage you to read more about Mawaru Penguindrum than that. The amount of theories and thoughts surrounding it is insane, and sometimes even the smallest things in each episode end up amounting to some sort of huge symbolism. [To give you an example of what I mean... (spoilers)](http://behind-the.nihonreview.com/20111204/interpreting-the-concept-of-fate-through-mawaru-penguindrums-visual-landscape/)

###Nisemonogatari? 
Why was there so much fanservice? [I would like to direct you to this brilliant article,](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/14/nisemonogatari-and-the-nature-of-fanservice/) written by /u/Bobduh. It should hopefully answer your question (and maybe change your PoV.)

###Serial Experiments Lain

Fair warning: Serial Experiments Lain, like much of Yoshitoshi ABe's work, is pretty much open to interpretation. [This horribly-designed website has a lot of detailed information](http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lain.htm) about Lain, although of course, they are only the author's interpretations.
