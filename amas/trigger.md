> **1. Looking back at past works like Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill, everything has a purpose, be it the skimpy Kamuis in KlK or the references to spirals that start at the very beginning of Gurren Lagann. So, do all the innuendos and sexual references in FranXX have that same importance that we'll learn about later in the series?**

You're really looking into our work. I appreciate it! Both KLK and TTGL is an Imaishi Hiroyuki directed title, and he really values the concept and designs for his work. I believe we took the same approach for Darling in the Franxx, but I believe Nishigori values what his viewers might enjoy more.

>**2. Have you heard of FranXX affectionately being referred to as "Doggystyle: The Anime" by fans in the West? What do you think of that?**


Damn really? I gotta share this with the director lol

>**3. Probably can't answer this, as it'd most likely be in spoiler territory, but... Is 02 basically a succubus-like creature as a result of her mixed blood? Having a character that sucks the life force out of most people she "rides" with in a sexually-heavy series makes it seem like that was the intention for her.**

I guess you gotta watch the entire series to get your answer for that question.

>**4. Is there ever a chance we'll get a sequel to Panty and Stocking? The cliffhanger was too much to take!**

 I really, really, REALLY do want to make it. I can say with confidence that the other staffs wants to make it as well. Sadly, matters are quite complicated for PSG.

/u/faux_wizard

>**1. As the man responsible for what became Panty&Stocking with Garterbelt, how do you feel about the critical success of the english dub? From our understanding, not much news about dub/voice overs really makes it back to Japan, but for a show that is both very western inspired and has a wide reputation here for having a strong dub I thought it would be worth the time asking you.**

I obviously cannot understand English. However, because it was dubbed in English, it really made it feel like we were able to make a 'cartoon' which we were trying to aim for.

> **2. What was your own personal favourite episode of PSG?**

Probably episode 12 part b to episode 13 part a&b

>**3. Darling in the FranXX was recently banned (then unbanned) in China. How much of an impact did this have on production? China is said to be a large source of international income for the industry, so was this occurrence enough to create some pressure on your end?**

Well, it was ultimately unbanned as you stated so I guess all is good for now! I'm not sure if there's much more to say for this question.

/u/DragonsOnOurMountain

>**1. I've mentioned two persons who I really look up to, but in your opinion, who at Trigger (or maybe any other studio or possibly freelancers) do you think should get more recognition?**

Kai Ikarashi. He's still young, but definitely talented. I look forward in working with him in the future as well.
He's also the chief animator for LWA (TV) episode 3.

>**2. You've worked as a producer for a long time at Trigger and Gainax; some of the anime you worked on were quite weird, especially Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. I'm wondering, have you ever seen someone come up with an idea that made you think "we can't do this"? What ultimately happened with that idea?**

PSG almost didn't go through. We were given special privilege since TTGL was so successful. Imaishi's Space Patrol Luluco was also turned down 3 times before the project was approved.

> **1/ There were rumors on some difficulties studio Trigger had to face with when making DitF episode 4 and 6. Will there be a solution to prevent such problems from happening again? Needless to say, I enjoy both episodes.**

Episode 4 and 6 was done mainly by TRIGGER, but I don't recall any problems/difficulties.

>**2/ Where did the production force take inspirations from to create such a dynamic cast in DitF? As I realized there are similarities between 02 and Asuka(in NGE), as well as there were many NGE references, can we expect the same crazy ending too?**

There might be some resemblance since the director Nishigori Atsushi is ex-GAINAX staff as well. I wouldn't say 02 and Asuka is too similar though. I suppose the coloring might be?

> **3/ I wish to know how much involvement do both Trigger and A-1 have in the production process of DitF. It really feels like a Trigger show. Does A-1 have any freedom on the creative sides when making an episode?**

The preproduction and design was mainly done by Nishigori and TRIGGER. The actual production is mainly executed by A-1.

> **4/ Can you shed some light on the creator code:000? Is this a name made for fun or there is an actual person behind it?**

It's just a name we gave to the core creative team for Darling in the Franxx. It's something like GEEK FLEET for PSG.

/u/DrewBreakman

> **Hello! Thank you for being here! As a huge fan of works produced from studio TRIGGER, I'm curious, what do you do when you feel creatively drained? Specifically, when you feel like you enjoy the concept of your work, but feel like you're slogging through it? If you do go through creative droughts like this, how do you move past it?**

I guess when I'm creatively drained, I try to look back to all the works that I admire(its usually a movie/films/photography/music)

They usually provide me with creative hints that I can incorporate to my work. I rarely find motivation from another anime title

/u/PhlipPhloppers

>**Thank you so much for Kill la Kill episode 4, not only is this my favorite of the series but one of my favorite anime episodes in general. So my question is will there be an episode in Darling in the FranXX written by you we can look forward to?**

I can't answer in details since it'll potentially spoil the fun. But, do look forward for one of the episode in the later half of the season!

And, thanks for watching ep 4 of KLK!

>**Also thanks for bringing us the gift that is Inferno Cop, to this date I haven't found anything that comes close to it. Are there any infos on the second season yet?**

We've been wanting to make IC2 as well, but the director is currently busy with his new title, SSSS. Gridman

>**You have a number of anime credits in MAL and ANN, but there are sometimes large gaps between them. Are you doing a lot of uncredited work in-between, does your work on these projects actually fill all the gaps or are you have other non-anime work you also tend to?**

In fact there's a lot of work I'm not credited for. For example, I helped out with the plot idea for Amanda's episode for LWA(TV).

I also occasionally do some creative direction for some apparel brands.

/u/Boroguard

> **I just wanted to get down to asking, what was the inspiration behind Zero Two? It’s definitely been noticeable that many people really do take a liking to Zero Two’s persona. Did you guys think that she’d be this popular when you were in the beginning stages of production?**

That question is best kept for after the show is finished!

/u/natokenichi

> **Hello and thank you everything you've worked on. Kill La Kill saved my life when I was in thr dakest place on my life, and for that from the bottom of my heart, thank you! But my question is, simply but importantly, who is your favorite girl? :)**

'm glad you made it through!
If we're exclusively talking about characters (girls) that we made, it's probably Panty from PSG.
***

/u/Mulder15

> **Hello Wakabayashi-san, I am a huge fan of your work and I'm thrilled you could join us. What would you say was your favorite project to work on?**

My favorite is always the project that I'm currently working on. Or else, I wouldn't participate to begin with, right? My favorite at the moment is Promare!

/u/PandavengerX

>**The animations done by Trigger, whether they be originals, adaptations, or even "non-anime" like the "Battlesaurs" segment from Toy Story 3, are always incredibly expressive and full of motion! This seems to carry over to even your most recent show, Darling in the Franxx, despite the fact it is a collaboration. What are some of Trigger's philosophies in regards to animating, and why do you think you guys emphasize having so much motion and expression in your animations?**

I believe the most important aspect of animation is the process of characterization. For example, the simple act of turning around is enough to portray one's character.The direction might be simple, but the animator must think what the character's motive is, how would the particular character react when he/she is animating the scene. With the above noted, we aspire to express our animation boldly. We will be loud for our actions, and we're not shy to show emotions as well.

>**What would be your favourite work when it comes to animation?**


If we're talking Japanese animation exclusively it'll be "FLCL" for OVA, "DIGIMON ADVENTURE CHILDREN'S WAR GAME!" for feature film, and "Kaleido Star" for TV series. 

>**Finally, a little bit of a selfish question. I did a little fan animation of 002 a month ago because I was excited for DarliFran! Would you mind telling me what you think of it?**
Link: https://gfycat.com/HugeBarrenHornshark

Thanks for the animation! It's even colored! You did an excellent job with the breeze effect. Love how it blows away with the "Z" shape at the end.

>**Darling in the Franxx is a co-production between A-1 Pictures and TRIGGER. Has there been any significant benefits or drawbacks to having two anime studios working on one anime?**

I like to think that we're (TRIGGER) decent when it comes to creating original contents. For Darling, TRIGGER was mainly in charge for concept planning and development. On the other hand, A-1's got the capacity to produce multiple titles throughout the year, and they're also known for their quality so we got a lot to learn from them when it comes to actual production. I wouldn't say this is a demerit, but since Darling was produced between two studios, the amount of staffs involved were also doubled. The project was more difficult to manage compared to others.


>**While studio TRIGGER is relatively young compared to most anime studios, I've noticed half of TRIGGER's TV anime works are 24-25 episodes long compared to most studios following 12-13 episodes. Is there a reason for that and does the episode length have any direct impact?**

We're a very fortunate studio to receive so many opportunity to produce original contents. Compared to adaptations, original series takes a lot longer to produce. We simply want our audience to enjoy the characters we took so long to create as much as possible. It also works in favor for the production committee since they have a longer span of time to market and sell their merchandise.

***

/u/KittoChan

>**Between Trigger and A1, which is the Stamen and Pistil?**

I guess TRIGGER would be the Stamen? Our studio's got that rowdy, rascal like vibe.

***

/u/SimoneNonvelodico

>**One criticism that is often made of Trigger is that it is a sort of "boys' club", both in terms of working environment and target demographic.**


>**Personally, while I don't know about the environment, I can understand why that is said of the demographic - but I also have the impression that in all the shows you produced, both Gainax and Trigger, there is a trend of heroines that have a very sort of aggressive, forwards sexuality. The most blatant example would be Panty Anarchy of course, but Yoko Littner, Satsuki Kiryuuin, Lalaco, and now Zero Two, all display some of these traits. Is this meant as an open criticism or subversion of the type of passive, "pure", shy anime female characters that often populate otaku shows? Or is it just done because someone in the staff thinks it's fun (or sexy)? Thanks!**

I'm really happy that some of our fans caught on to this. I cannot speak for all of our titles, but I can say with confidence that Panty and Lalaco are heavily influenced by my preference. I like to think that their openness to sexuality can be perceived as a symbol of freedom.

/u/DarkBladeEkkusu

>**what made you guys decide to do the recap episode fake out at the beginning of episode 16 in Kill la Kill?**

I believe this was both Imaishi and Nakashima's idea. We wanted to include a recap episode, but at the same time had so many contents to cover... So we decided to cram it all in before the opening sequence kicked in.

***

/u/just_kei

>**i'd like to know if studio trigger has animators that work digitally instead of traditionally. And what are chances of the studio hiring animators from other countries to work on a project**

It'll take us some time to make the transition to full digital animation, but we are doing our best to incorporate new technology in our shorter projects. We've still yet to hire any foreign digital animators, but hopefully in the future if there's desirable talents.

/u/Waddles-inc

>**I’d say a trademark of a studio trigger is how enthusiastically the show will wear it’s heart on its sleeve. So I’m curious about how early into the conception process is a characters arc or development is considered**

1) We start with the scenario first, and move onto the character design once we have a solid foundation. We then work on both the script and design linearly.

>**Out of all the Trigger shows my absolute favorite has to be Space Patrol Luluco, so when I discovered that it was the origins of Trigger-chan it made me curious whether this was always supposed to be her backstory or if this was just a neat idea added after the fact?**

2)I actually made the pitch to the director to have Luluco transform into Trigger-chan. If I recall correctly, I made this presentation fairly early in the production phase. I hope that I can produce another series that features all 3 Trigger girls in the future.

/u/CoffeePooPoo

>**Will we see models for the FranXX? I'd really like to build something like a master grade Strelizia!**

We actually made an announcement recently to release a model kit of strelitzia from Good Smile Company! The model will also be quality checked by Shigeto Koyama himself so keep an eye out for the release date!

***

/u/InfiniteSheep999

>**As the individual with the original concept for Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt did you have any imput on the original designs that Yoh Yoshinari made before Atsushi Nishigori would adjust them to TV animation?**

Since I was involved in the script/scenario for PSG, there was several occasions where I asked Yoshinari to revise his designs.

>**Noted on your credits on ANN(AnimeNewsNetwork) is for being a production runner on Dennoh Coil. I'm not really versed on the different roles in animation production but was that a noticeable experience in any way?**

2) I've always been a big fan of Mr. Iso so it was an honor to work with him. Although, I'll have to admit that it was challenging to work in an environment that I'm not familiar with.

/u/ClarRir


>**Also speaking of Darling in the FranXX, what happens to the girls when they are in theFranxx? Do they have plenty control over it or they just relay on the boys? Can a boy be in their place?**

The girls are mainly responsible for the ignition while the boys pilot the Franxx. The girls also hold the initiative for the Franxx's functionality since they can technically activate the machine without the boys (the stampede mode). Although, Zero-Two is the only female character known to be capable of this. The boy and girls role in piloting the Franxx are not interchangeable.

/u/Matuin92

>**One of the things I love about a show like Inferno Cop is that literally anything could happen from one episode to another. I was wondering what kinds of challenges you faced when working on the plot for Inferno Cop and if there were any ideas you had that didn’t make the final cut?**

Thank you! There's actually a lot of ideas that didn't make it to the final cut for Inferno Cop. We had plans for Inferno Cop where he would travel to France to battle a local super hero, the "Euro-people." Many other characters like the Euro-people didn't make it into the series so I hope we can feature them in future episodes.

/u/Aildaris

>**as someone who is an aspiring filmmaker/writer and voice actor (i'm 19, i have yet to find what I want to do out of those three), what would you reccomend doing for voice acting? I practice quite a lot at home and some of my strengths are non human characters. **

The best advice I can provide is to watch live action film and theatrical plays. Anything that's not anime, really. I also notice this in many young voice actors, but they're too occupied on trying to act out the character too "cool" or "cute" and they often forget to sympathize with their roles. The most important factor of a voice actor is to understand their characters.

***

/u/Hikaix

>**How exactly was Inferno Cop conceived? Were there any inspiration from an existing work?**


Shigeto Koyama came up with the burning police concept. Imaishi and myself came up with the story, while Amemiya was responsible for direction. It's hard to say whose idea it was at this point. 

***

/u/TwoRocksAndaDuck

>**Was Darling in the Franxx partially inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion? I rarely watch Mecha and Kaiju anime because a lot of them are bland and typical, but Darling in the Franxx was one of the few that really caught my eye ever since Evangelion!**

Thank you for supporting Gurren Lagann. It was actually Guren's 10 year anniversary last year, and we held a collaboration event just recently. I personally feel that the event was well received by our fans so I hope to continue this trend by collaborating with our GAINAX title in the future.

/u/MEiiYo

>**1) As a creative producer, your job is to make this unique premise works. So, how did you or your team come with all this idea? Did you just one day say "How about we make this and see how it goes" jokingly and somehow make that project come to life later?**

Let's take Kill la Kill as an example. Kill l a Kill's story/premise will probably make sense even if it took place in modern day Japan. However, by using a fictional setting, we're able to visually supplement the premise as well. In the opening scene of Kill la Kill, we see Ryuko looking up to the mountain, which is the Honnouji Academy. The viewers can then assume that Ryuko will be going through many hardships throughout the series.

Even if it may sound absurd on paper, it's important to come up with ideas/concept that will visually compliment the premise.
 
>**2) Again, famous show from your studio are those in action genre. I assumed that Promare will also probably be in that genre. Do you have plan to make more anime with story like InoBato and Kiznaiver in the future? To me Studio Trigger can still shine with title revolves around drama and slice of life.**

Hopefully sometime in the future since we regularly receive request for another slice of life genre.

***

/u/Chronoterminus

>**Are you ever surprised by what western anime fans like or dislike? (Do tastes differ that much?)**

Comedy is one of my favorite genre, and I've noticed that American comedy is on another level. I'm really glad that both PSG and Luluco was so well received in the states. Japan on the other hand, the viewer seems to be more entertained by simple slice of life genres. 2) If I had to choose, it'd be Miku since Argentea is cute as well.

>**And, of course, the obligatory: Who is, in your opinion, best girl?**

If I had to choose, it'd be Miku since Argentea is cute as well.

***

/u/VariousTypesOfSoups

>**Is there anything in particular that stood out to your as your most memorable moment all throughout the years?**

Spiderman joining the marvel universe is probably my most memorable/exciting news in recent years. 


***

/u/androidnoobbaby

>**In Evangelion, Diebuster and Gurren-Lagann, the mecha have their own consciousness. Would you say that this inspired you to take it even further with the DarliFra, which blurs the line between character and robot with the Pistils and the Franxx being extensions of each other?**


I'm surprised that you've caught on to that. You've definitely studied the concept for GAINAX mech series. Darling in the Franxx definitely follows this trend. I cannot disclose any information, but I hope you enjoy the rest of Darling in the Franxx!

/u/Iamjustatrial

>**Hi Mr Hiromi & Mr Masahiko, could you tell us more about the inspiration and conception of the FranXX controls – the very creative doggy style butt controls! Did the team experiment with 2 people in various kinky positions before the current doggy position was picked? I can only imagine how funny it would be doing that!**

>**What were the other interesting positions which were considered, and would we possibly see them in the anime as a different FranXX pilot control?**

Basically no single design is designed by a single individual. The director will usually place an order or a request and the design team will work together to comply. All of our design include some input provided by the entire team so we cannot say "so and so" was designed by a specific person.

/u/ArchadianJudge

>**Since there are already many questions, I will ask a simple one. Who do you prefer more? Zero Two or Ichigo? And why? I find it hard to pick a favorite because they are both so amazing!**

Hmm... If I had to choose, it'd be Zero Two. She's however not a waifu material. I guess I'm attracted to her charismatic personality.

***

/u/bioclife

>**What are some of your favorite Western cartoons?**

That's a difficult question. So many to choose from... I think my top favorites are Simpsons, Billy and Mandy, Kim Possible, Drawn Together, Gravity Falls.

***

/u/Lunarkmb

>**Who was responsible for the character design for Zero Two from DitFXX, where did they get inspiration to come up with such a beautiful design?**

That will probably be Atsushi Nisigori (Director) and Masayoshi Tanaka (Character design)

/u/xERR404x

>**Hi! In your staff credits, among the production and directorial work you've done, you have a number of credits that are just listed as publicity and I was wondering what that entails. Does it mean you were involved with creating things like PVs, promotional websites, and other ad campaigns, or is there another side to it that the general public might not be aware of?**

This is because I have multiple responsibility for that particular project. I function as a creative producer while leading the PR team for studio TRIGGER. This is exclusive for myself, but my work varies from directing the key visual, trailers, magazine/web ad, and quality control/direction for merchandise. I pretty much oversee anything related to branding of our title.

***

/u/NextFire

>**What are your main reasons for choosing to produce your new animes in co-production with other studios?**

We've decided to work in collaboration with A-1 pictures since the director specifically requested to do so. TRIGGER was mainly in charge of pre-production since coming up with original content is what we do best. A-1 on the other hand handles most of the actual animation process. However, there are few episodes that we were responsible for, and few designs did come from creators of A-1 as well.

***

/u/isumairu25

>**Did it really take 8 months to draw Ryuko Matoi?**

I believe it took us about 1.5 years for her design. However, we were working on other characters as well so it's a bit difficult to present an exact number. The design concept for Kill la Kill was based on 70's shonen manga so it was exceptionally difficult to refine them to modern taste.


***


/u/MetaSoshi9

>**Will we ever see an anime or manga adaption of the backstories of the Little Witch Academia characters mentioned at Anime Expo?**

Producer Tsutsumi says that maybe someday if there's enough demands.


***


/u/Komnenos_Kasuki

>**Do you plan your projects carefully or do you jump right into them and see where the story or projects takes you?**

When I participate in the scripting session of a project, I usually let my characters make their own decisions. However, I do keep the main theme and the climax of the story so they don't stray off to much. It's always pleasant surprise when the characters are able to come up with a more interesting turn of events.


***

/u/FeliFeathers

>**I identify as a lesbian, and I couldn’t help but find Darling’s premise and themes very alienating. I’m not here to accuse anyone of anything, I would just like to know if the potentially exclusionary implications ever occurred to anyone during production.**

I don't think any of the production staff feel that way. It's not directly implied, but Darling does feature some homosexuality in the series as well.

***

/u/Einlar

>**Are Gurren Lagann, Little witch academia and Kill la Kill all set in the same universe at different points in time? My fan theory is that Akko's using spiral energy, and Croix will be the founder of the Anti-spirals.**

Technically they exist in a different universe. However, we have few characters such as Trigger-chan and Inferno cop with the ability to cross between these walls and limitations. 

***

/u/Cryzzalis

>**With the western market growing ever larger and being taken notice of, are there more creators who try to cater towards the western market? In your opinion, is that a good or a bad thing?**

Streaming services are starting to pick up in Japan as well, so it's only natural that the committee will request for a project that is aimed for a western audience. We would like to continue to produce a series that is aimed toward a more global audience (Not just Western and Japanese)

***

/u/No_04

>**I love Space Patrol Luluco, it's one of my favorite series. Do you guys have plans for other short anime (besides Inferno Cop)?**

Both Imaishi and myself really love Space Patrol Luluco's format, so hopefully we'll be able continue with the series in the future.

> **Mascots like Muzzle and Spring will receive their own anime? We'll be able to see Trigger-chan again in one of your future works?**


I almost view it as a duty to deliver the other 2 girls at this point.

>**I am a big fan of Trigger's work, and have follow the trajectory of many of it's creators since the days of the old Gainax. You can't image how excited I am for this! There's so much I'd like to ask, but I'll try to be brief.**

>**I loved Little Witch Academia, both the recent TV series and the original that you writed. My question is simple, even if you were not involved in the first season of the TV series, if there is ever a second season of the show, will you like to go back to being the scriptwriter, or do you feel like your work with the franchise is done?**


I actually participated as script for few episodes for the television series as well. I'm quite attached to the characters of LWA so I would definitely be interested in taking part once again if opportunity is provided.

/u/androidnoobbaby

>**This is for Otsuka, if he arrives:**

>**Hello! I've been a big fan since the Gainax days! There should be no need to mention Gurren-Lagann, so I'll say that I really enjoyed Petite Princess Yucie! I liked everyone but Glenda and Elmina were the best!**


>**Some Trigger related works seem to have certain patterns. For example, Imaishi's works happen every 3 years! And there are 2 years between Little Witch Academia, as well. Is this intentional? Can we expect Promare and a follow up to LWA in 2019?**

Thanks for watching Petite Princess Yucie!

Imaishi and Yoshinari is indeed the main directors of our studio. However, we do have younger creators like Akira Amemiya working on their own original titles as well. To answer your question, we don't technically have a routine going, it just happens to take us about 2 to 3 years to produce an original content. I'd personally love to continue with the LWA franchise but there's nothing I can say officially at this moment.

>**If I remember right, Nia was Otsuka-san's favorite for Gurren-Lagann. I like her as well. Who are Otsuka-san's favorites from Trigger's shows?**

My favorite character is Midori from Space Patrol Luluco.

>**In his Twitter account, Otsuka-san recommended Yucie to fans of Little Witch Academia. Will Trigger do another family friendly show of that sort?**

No plans at the moment, but we are definitely interested in producing more family friendly titles.

>**Hello, thank you for taking time out of your busy days to answer these questions.**


>**1)I've heard in passing that you keep up with all seasonal anime which I find must be a difficult task. Is there anything that you particularly like from the 2018 Winter season or is it more a obligation to keep up with these shows?**


There's a lot of quality series this year, but my personal favorite would be A Story that leads to the Antarctica.


>**2) My apologies in that I don't have full knowledge of when you began in the industry but one interesting credit that shows up while researching your name is being an assistant director on Pom Poko. What was like working in Ghibli under Isao Takahata? Would you apply anything you learn to your first full length role as a director on Petite Princess Yucie?**


My practical knowledge and ethics for directing is based off Mr. Takahata's teachings. He's originally not an animation director so his method definitely set a guideline for my career.

>**We have some questions for Ōtsuka-san. There are 7(+1), probably a little bit too much, so feel free to choose whichever ones you prefer.**

>**2) Why Akko's name, on official merchandising etc, etc, is never written in kanji but in katakana?**


I'm actually not aware if Akko's name has an official Kanji for her name. Maybe Yoshinari or Tsutsumi might have an answer.


>**3) Why the first 言の葉 (kotonoha) has changed from マクミル ミクミル メクトラヌ to ノット オーフェ オーデン フレトール?**


The spell for the television series was revised to better suit Mrs. Shimada's script.


>**5) How old are Akko and the others? Maybe 14?**


Akko enrolled to Luna Nova after graduating middle school so she must be around 15 to 16 years old.

>**I've noticed that the Strelizia theme sounds a lot like Hiroyuki Sawano's work in Kill la Kill. Was it a conscious decision to remind us of that or was it just a pleasant coincidence? How much work goes into planning the show's soundtrack?**

It's probably because Ms. Tachibana is Mr. Sawano's student.

>**Will there be more video games based on Trigger anime to come after LWA: Chamber of Time? A lot of people have expressed interest in a KLK video game; specifically made by Platinum Games, and Platinum Games have expressed interest themselves on Twitter.**

> **Given Trigger's love for Western Animation, and your plans to work on something (tv series or OVAs) for the general public (something for international viewers, I imagine), would you maybe consider:**

>**1- working on an adaptation from classic literature / theater?**

Hiromi/Shigeto: Yes, and yes.

> **How tough is it for aspiring animators outside of Japan to enter the anime industry?(i.e, if a foreigner were to send an application to your studio for an animating job, would you consider him? What qualities would be a huge X factor that would influence the studio to take him in? )**

Hiromi/Shigeto: We've got internet now, and the industry is shifting to digital animation. You don't really have to be living in Japan to work for the industry. If you can communicate (speak/read/write Japanese) all you need is talent.

> **How does Shigeto Koyama come up with his designs for the mechas in Darling in the Franxx? What does he use for inspiration?**

Shigeto: I first received a list of request/order from Director Nishigori, and brainstormed with the TRIGGER design team to start with. I went on several design boot camp session with TRIGGER to come up with the designs.

>**Do you guys like action or slice of life more**

Hiromi: If it's just watching, I need to have some sort of drama going on in the series.
Shigeto: I guess actions? But they can't be humans (they have to be cars, mechs, etc)
