###Credit goes to /u/aruseus493 for this writeup.

**Nature of Adaptions** - Most anime are adaptions of various manga, light novels, and visual novels. Frequently, but not always, they are produced to boost sales of the source material. They don't normally adapt the entire manga, light novel, or visual novels stories. Details, side stories, and later stories aren't adapted often.

**Not Enough Sales** - If the latest season does not sell well enough to justify the cost of production for the season, another season will likely not be made. Sales here include things like merchandise and BDs.

**Lack of a Sales Boost** - If no boost in sale occurs for the source material, the adaption may not be performing its intended purpose. Depending on the production, this may impact its chances for further adaptation.

**Guaranteed Loss Per Season** - It's almost guaranteed that each consecutive season will sell less than the previous season. This means there will be fewer and fewer people that will be interested in the series as most series cannot be entered late like most Western Television.

**Not Ongoing Source Material** - As some adaptions are meant to sell the source material, the source material needs to be ongoing for a greater effect. There are almost no new adaptions for completed series.

**Not Enough Source Material** - If a series is extremely popular, there isn't much possible if there isn't enough material to adapt. This is very common when it comes to Light Novels or monthly manga series where they can adapt more than half of the series in a single season.

These are the largest reasons for why there are no more seasons for Anime X. There are various other facts that you should know below as well.

**Low Income from Foreign Markets** - The anime industry is mostly self-reliant on everything within Japan. Foreign markets are just not willing to pay large prices for anime the same way they do in Japan. This coupled with the fact that the foreign market is a niche as well means that there isn't much worth in investing in the foreign market. There's also the fact that the anime are meant to advertise the source material where in the foreign market, anime is the end for most people which means they can't be expected to buy the source material which has a high chance of not even being licensed.

**Animation Studios' Work Force** - Animation Studios are not infinitely full. There are x number of animators required for a project and they can either be working on another season which is sure to sell less than the previous season or they could be working on a new fresh project with a higher chance of success. Animation studios try not to limit themselves to franchises.

**Interest** - Individual opinion does play a role as well. People can make decisions based on opinion rather than just potential figures. If the Producers are genuinely interested in another season of a show, they can influence another season. If an author doesn't like the adaption, they can fight another season. The main casts could all be working on other projects and are absolutely booked to be unable to come together for another season.

**Anime Original Series** - These are series designed for the medium. They are written specifically to be animated and tend to end at the finish of the story. Using Kill la Kill or Code Geass as examples, these are series that have ended with completed plot lines in all ways. Any further seasons would be forced and likely low in quality. They would likely have genre shifts to fit into the canon of the series or would have really bad new development which would undermine the original story. That doesn't mean spin-offs aren't possible though for a number of series and sometimes, completed series do get more seasons which were unexpected. (Psycho-Pass)

Now let me clarify that exceptions do exist for each of these points. That's all they are though, exceptions. Rare occurrences that you cannot put faith in for repetition. Those series are miracles wrapped within miracles and you're likely able to count them all with only your fingers.
I hope this is helpful for understanding and answering any questions you might have.
