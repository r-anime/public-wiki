A resource for finding the threads for titles discussed on /r/anime. A work in progress, if you would like to report an error or want something to be added, please send a PM (Private Message on Reddit) to /u/notathrowaway75 or /u/Mpuddi.

The archive is a collaborative effort, so it would also be extremely helpful if volunteering users could collect episode discussion threads for any currently airing show (which can be submitted at the end of the season), or completed show not already present in the wiki. If possible, please submit using a similar format to the one in use.
